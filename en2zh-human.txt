2	This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism , idealism  overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: Paris: 1843–1845	18	在《關於費爾巴哈的提綱》中包含了馬克思對於唯物主義的思考、理想主義理論與實踐理念的關係、以及抽象現實凌駕於物理世界的批判等。	2 ::: 1	共產黨 ::: 巴黎時期	18
2	It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: Paris: 1843–1845	19	在此馬克思首次提出對於歷史唯物主義的想法，認為世界的改變並非基於想法概念，而是透過實際的、物理的、物質性的活動和實踐進行。	2 ::: 1	共產黨 ::: 巴黎時期	19
2	In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down "Vorwärts! ", with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: Paris: 1843–1845	20	、其中普魯士國王要求法國政府查禁《前進周刊》，並且要求法國部長會議首席弗朗索瓦·基佐驅逐馬克思。	2 ::: 1	共產黨 ::: 巴黎時期	20
2	However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	0	1845年2月，馬克思移民到比利時布魯塞爾，他承諾在比利時將不針對當代政治主題發表相關意見。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	0
2	In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	1	。 很快地，他便與德國哲學家莫塞斯·赫斯、德國作家卡爾·海因岑、普魯士新聞工作者約瑟夫·魏德邁等來自歐洲各地的社會主義者會面。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	1
2	In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	2	1845年4月，恩格斯從德國巴門搬到布魯塞爾，並與馬克思會面，同時，正義者同盟內部也越來越多幹部成員前往布魯塞爾並且以此為據點	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	2
2	In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the Chartists, a socialist movement in Britain.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	3	1845年7月中旬，馬克思和恩格斯離開布魯塞爾，前往英國訪問憲章運動領導人。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	3
2	Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	4	在這之前，恩格斯從1842年11月至1844年8月便花了2年的時間住在曼徹斯特。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	4
2	Not only did Engels already know the English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	5	這使得恩格斯不僅已經懂得英語，並且曾與許多憲章運動的領導人有著密切關係。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	5
2	Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	6	事實上恩格斯過去作為英語報刊的記者，曾經發表許多憲章運動和社會主義的文章。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	6
2	Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	7	馬克思則趁著這次旅行的契機，大量研究收藏在倫敦和曼徹斯特的各種經濟相關資料文獻。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	7
2	In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of historical materialism, "The German Ideology".	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	8	其後馬克思和恩格斯合作著手撰寫新的著作《德意志意識形態》。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	8
2	In this work, Marx broke with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with Karl Grun and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism".	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	9	其中馬克思打破過去路德維希·安德列斯·費爾巴哈、布魯諾·鮑威爾、麥克斯·施蒂納和青年黑格爾派的主張，同時也反對如德國記者卡爾·格律恩和其他社會主義者提出的部分「理想主義」理念。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	9
2	In "German Ideology", Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	10	在《德意志意識形態》一書中馬克思和恩格斯批判黑格爾的辯證法與費爾巴哈唯物主義的不徹底性，從而首次系統地闡述他們所創立的歷史唯物主義。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	10
2	"German Ideology" is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	11	《德意志意識形態》大體上是以幽默諷刺的形式撰寫，即便如此，仍然沒有獲得審查機關通過。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	11
2	Like so many other early writings of his, "German Ideology" would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	12	就像馬克思許多早期著作一樣，《德意志意識形態》在馬克思生前始終沒有獲得發表，並且一直到1932年才首次出版。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	12
2	After completing "German Ideology", Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	13	《德意志意識形態》完成後，馬克思開始將自己的工作主軸從原本的科學唯物主義理念的確定，轉向至以此角度澄清他對無產階級革命運動真正的理論和策略	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	13
2	This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	14	而其目的在於區分空想社會主義者和馬克思自己的科學社會主義哲學之間的差異。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	14
2	Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class  with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	15	其中烏托邦主義者認為必須要說服過去有著不同信仰的人們願意在同一時間參加社會主義運動，然而馬克思認為在大多數情況下人們往往會根據自己的經濟權益而有所行動。 因此馬克思計畫在新的著作中針對以勞工為首的階級撰寫具龐大吸引力的論述，透過該階級所重視的物質利益提供動員大量群眾之能量，進而發展成為變革和改變社會的最佳方式。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	15
2	This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book "The Poverty of Philosophy"  and offered it as a response to the "petty bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book "The Philosophy of Poverty" .	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	16	不過為了使手稿得以通過政府機關的審查，馬克思透過這本書回應法國無政府主義者皮耶-約瑟夫·普魯東於1840年的著作《經濟矛盾的體系，或貧困的哲學》，批評其「小資產階級哲學」並且將書命名為《哲學的貧困》，	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	16
2	These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as "The Communist Manifesto".	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	17	這本書後來更成為馬克思和恩格斯最著名的作品《共產黨宣言》之基礎。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	17
2	While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	18	1846年，居住在布魯塞爾的馬克思和恩格斯建立布魯塞爾共產主義通訊委員會，並且繼續與秘密激進組織正義者同盟有所交流。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	18
2	As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	19	其中馬克思認為正義者同盟作為激進組織，應當促進歐洲各地的工人階級發起群眾運動，進而擴大成為工人階級的革命；	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	19
2	However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party. Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	20	然而如果要組織工人階級並且擴展成為群眾運動，意味著正義者同盟不得不放棄「秘密」或「地下」性質，並且作為政黨開始從事相關行動。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	20
2	Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.  This new open political society was called the Communist League.  Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	21	1847年馬克思和恩格斯應邀參加正義者同盟，而正義者同盟成員最終則被兩人的主張所說服。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	21
2	In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work – a programme of action for the Communist League.  Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, "The Communist Manifesto" was first published on 21 February 1848.  "The Communist Manifesto" laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	22	馬克思和恩格斯參與共產主義者同盟的規章制定和組織架構建立，並且在從1847年12月至1848年兩人則開始為共產主義者同盟撰寫共同行動綱領。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	22
2	No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	23	其中不再是秘密社團的共產主義者同盟不應該如過去正義者同盟繼續隱藏其信念，相反地應當把目的和方針明確朝向廣大的市民。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	23
2	The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	24	在《共產黨宣言》中的一開頭便是由馬克思所提出的「至今所有一切社會的歷史都是階級鬥爭的歷史」，	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	24
2	It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie  and the proletariat .	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	25	之後馬克思則描述資產階級和無產階級之間的利益衝突將會產生對立。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	25
2	Proceeding on from this, the "Manifesto" presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	26	同時在宣言中還認為相較於其他社會主義和自由主義政黨和團體，僅有共產主義者同盟提出的主張才真正能保障無產階級的利益，進而推翻資本主義並且建立社會主義社會。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	26
2	Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolutions of 1848.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	27	1848年2月21日由馬克思起草的《共產黨宣言》正式發表，內容中確立了新成立的共產主義者同盟其主要信念。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	27
2	In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	28	其中法國爆發二月革命推翻帝制，從而建立法蘭西第二共和國，並且以此支持相關活動。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	28
2	Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father  of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	29	據稱他曾經使用這筆錢三度支援比利時工人籌備武裝並且策劃發起革命行動，	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	29
2	Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Brussels: 1845–1848	30	隨後馬克思則遭到比利時政府驅逐。	2 ::: 2	共產黨 ::: 在布魯塞爾	30
2	Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a German Workers' Club with various German socialists living there.	1 ::: 5	Biography ::: Cologne: 1848–1849	0	暫時安頓在巴黎後，恩格斯也在不久跟著返回巴黎居住。	2 ::: 3	共產黨 ::: 科隆時期	0
2	Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the "Demands of the Communist Party in Germany",  in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the "Communist Manifesto", believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the feudal monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.	1 ::: 5	Biography ::: Cologne: 1848–1849	1	由於希望看到革命能夠蔓延至德國， 搬至科隆居住的馬克思在那裡開始發表名為《德國共產黨的要求》之傳單，在內容中重新審視《共產黨宣言》所主張的10項做法，認為德國資產階級必須在無產階級推翻資產階級前，先行推翻當時的封建君主和貴族制度。	2 ::: 3	共產黨 ::: 科隆時期	1
2	On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the "Neue Rheinische Zeitung", which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father.	1 ::: 5	Biography ::: Cologne: 1848–1849	2	6月1日，馬克思透過他近期從父親繼承來的財產創辦日報《新萊茵報》。	2 ::: 3	共產黨 ::: 科隆時期	2
2	Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting, although each time he was acquitted.	1 ::: 5	Biography ::: Cologne: 1848–1849	3	不過包括馬克思和其他革命社會主義者由於擔任報紙編輯而經常定期遭到警方騷擾，馬克思本人便曾因侮辱首席檢察官、報導違法新聞內容、涉嫌透過抵制稅收煽動武裝叛亂等指控而遭到審訊，不過每次他都獲得無罪釋放。	2 ::: 3	共產黨 ::: 科隆時期	3
2	Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.	1 ::: 5	Biography ::: Cologne: 1848–1849	4	同時由普魯士重要人士組成的法蘭克福國民議會遭到解散，國王腓特烈·威廉四世則提拔了原本反對改革措施的成員，並且排除普魯士新內閣內部的左派成員和其他改革分子。	2 ::: 3	共產黨 ::: 科隆時期	4
2	Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	0	1849年8月馬克思移居至英國倫敦並且在此度過餘生	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	0

2	However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	2	在1849年至1850年，總部移往倫敦的共產主義者同盟內部發生分裂，其中德國社會主義者奧古斯特·維利希和卡爾·夏佩爾領導的一派主張立即起義。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	2
2	Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	3	維利希和夏佩爾認為一旦共產主義者同盟發起起義後，歐洲各地的工人階級將會自發性地跟進發起行動，因此在歐洲將能爆發革命。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	3
2	Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	4	馬克思和恩格斯則在共產主義者同盟中反對這一想法，認為這樣並未完善計劃的起義是「冒險主義」，並最終導致共產主義者同盟自身毀滅。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	4
2	Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	5	馬克思認為維利希和夏佩爾一群人主張的起義行動，很容易便會被歐洲保守政府之警方和軍隊所壓制	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	5
2	Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	6	，對此他認為如此進行將會造成共產主義者同盟的覆滅。 馬克思認為社會改變並非少數人在一夜間便能實現	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	6
2	They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	7	，相反地則是對社會經濟狀況進行科學分析後，隨著社會不同發展階段而發起革命。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	7
2	In the present stage of development , following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal  suffrage.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	8	在1848年歐洲各地革命失敗後，馬克思認為共產主義者同盟應該鼓勵工人階級團結，與新興資產階級的進步分子合作共同擊敗封建貴族，並且提出具有自由選舉而成的議會、男性公民投票權的立憲共和國政府之改革要求	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	8
2	In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	9	這也意味著工人階級必須與資產階級民主勢力合作才能促使資產階級革命成功，不過最終仍以工人階級主導並且組織階級革命。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	9
2	After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	10	共產主義者同盟在經過長期內部鬥爭後，馬克思主張將造成組織瓦解的觀點佔了上風，最終維利希和夏佩爾等人離開共產主義者同盟。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	10
2	Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	11	同時，馬克思也積極參與了同樣支持社會主義的德國工人教育協會	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	11
2	The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	12	該協會主要在倫敦市中心的娛樂區倫敦蘇荷區大風車街舉行會議。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	12
2	This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	13	然而就如同共產主義者同盟因為行動問題而發生內部分裂，德國工人教育協會內部成員也分成支持馬克思想法者以及跟隨夏佩爾和維利希做法兩派。	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	13
2	The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.	1 ::: 6	Biography ::: Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860	14	最終在這次與夏佩爾和維利希一派的鬥爭中，馬克思失去了德國工人教育協會內部成員的支持，並且於1850年9月17日退出協會職務；	3 ::: 1	流放後 ::: 前往倫敦	14

2	While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it  from all sides".	1 ::: 8	Biography ::: The First International and "Capital"	19	雖然馬克思在信中承認從俄羅斯農村建立的組織公社是俄羅斯社會復興的出發點，但是他也表示在未經歷資本主義階段而直接轉移至社會主義階段時，應當以和平行動方式作為主要手段。	3 ::: 5	流放後 ::: 晚年生活	2
2	Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.	1 ::: 8	Biography ::: The First International and "Capital"	20	其中馬克思認為首先必須消除各方可能對於組織公社的質問所帶來的負面影響，而在全面解決負面影響後馬克思所提到的組織公社自行正常發展的情況才可能存在。	3 ::: 5	流放後 ::: 晚年生活	3

2	Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought, Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the economic system can bring about real change.	3 ::: 1	Thought ::: Influences	0	雖然馬克思的靈感來自法國社會主義和社會學思想，但是他也批判當時的空想社會主義支持者；其中他認為空想社會主義者青睞小規模的社會主義社會，反就導致其被邊緣化並且面臨貧困問題，對此馬克思認為只有大規模變革經濟體系才可以帶來真正的變化。	5 ::: 1	思想 ::: 理論發展	0
2	The other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, "The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844", which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution, as well as from the social democrat Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz, who in "Die Bewegung der Produktion" described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."	3 ::: 1	Thought ::: Influences	1	另外恩格斯在1844年的著作《英國工人階級狀況》也大大影響馬克思對於黑格爾思想的詮釋，從而導致馬克思透過歷史辯證法而設想出階級鬥爭衝突，並且認為現代工人階級作為革命最為進步的力量。	5 ::: 1	思想 ::: 理論發展	1
2	Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts.	3 ::: 1	Thought ::: Influences	2	馬克思認為在學習歷史和社會科學後將能夠洞悉歷史發展，進而發現推動發展結果的社會矛盾因素；也因此馬克思的一些追隨者做出結論，認為共產主義革命將必定會發生。	5 ::: 1	思想 ::: 理論發展	2
2	However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "Theses on Feuerbach" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.	3 ::: 1	Thought ::: Influences	3	但是馬克思在《關於費爾巴哈的提綱》第十一條中提到他著名的「哲學家們只是用不同的方式解釋世界，問題在於改變世界。」名言，仍然認為必須要實際付出行動以改變世界。	5 ::: 1	思想 ::: 理論發展	3
2	Like Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot, Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with Montesquieu, who discussed the nature of the single despot.	3 ::: 2 ::: 1	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Human nature	0	如同法國政治社會學家亞歷西斯·德·托克維爾提出匿名且暗中獨裁的官僚專制主義，馬克思則反對過去許多古典思想家對於專制的理論，這包括有曾經提出單一專制的法國思想家孟德斯鳩。	5 ::: 2	思想 ::: 人性主體	0
2	For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders its potential counterpart an object to be apprehended.	3 ::: 2 ::: 1	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Human nature	1	對此馬克思和黑格爾都主張自我發展的開端，源自於內部異化的經驗認識而自動生成，接著產生作為主體行動者的真實自我感覺，並且得以確認潛在的對應客體，	5 ::: 2	思想 ::: 人性主體	1
2	in desired ways the subject takes the object as its own and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human.	3 ::: 2 ::: 1	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Human nature	2	主體將繼續讓客體成為其自身，並讓個體得以實現而成為完整的人。	5 ::: 2	思想 ::: 人性主體	2
2	Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that "the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects".	3 ::: 2 ::: 1	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Human nature	3	因此馬克思在從黑格爾的觀點加以延伸後出發，並且認為人的自然存在是「肉體的、有自然力的、有生命的、現實的、感性的、對象性的存在物，這就等於說人有現實的、感性的對象作為自己的本質——自己生命表現的對象，或者說人只有憑藉現實的、感性的對象才能表現自己的生命。」	5 ::: 2	思想 ::: 人性主體	3
2	Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian "work" into material "labour" and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term "labour power".	3 ::: 2 ::: 1	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Human nature	4	因此馬克思把黑格爾原先所提的「工作」改稱作「勞動」，並且將在人能力範圍內改造自然的能力稱作「勞動力」。	5 ::: 2	思想 ::: 人性主體	4
2	As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	0	如同辯證法般，馬克思也是從黑格爾的著作中開始引用異化的概念，但特別是依據其唯物主義歷史觀進行推導。	5 ::: 3	思想 ::: 異化理論	0
2	An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface to his 1843 "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right": Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	1	另外馬克思認為類似的虛假意識還有像是對宗教等事物的分析，其中馬克思於1843年的著作《黑格爾法哲學批判》序言中提到：  宗教裡的苦難既是現實的苦難的表現，又是對這種現實的苦難的抗議。	5 ::: 4	思想 ::: 階級鬥爭	0
2	Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	2	宗教是被壓迫生靈的嘆息，是無情世界的感情，正像它是沒有精神的制度的精神一樣。	5 ::: 4	思想 ::: 階級鬥爭	1

2	The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	4	廢除作為人民幻想的幸福的宗教，也就是要求實現人民的現實的幸福。	5 ::: 4	思想 ::: 階級鬥爭	3
2	To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	5	要求拋開關於自己處境的幻想，也就是要求拋開那需要幻想的處境。	5 ::: 4	思想 ::: 階級鬥爭	4
2	Whereas his Gymnasium senior thesis at the de argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of solidarity, here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic "status quo" and inequality.	3 ::: 2 ::: 2	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Labour, class struggle and false consciousness	6	儘管馬克思在文理中學的畢業論文表示宗教其主要目的是促進社會有機團結，不過之後他則轉向指出宗教的社會功能在於凸顯和維護政治和經濟現狀的各方面不平等。	5 ::: 4	思想 ::: 階級鬥爭	5

2	Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.	3 ::: 3 ::: 3	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Economy, history and society	4	同時馬克思認為經濟為首的下層建築和社會為首的上層建築間如果發生衝突的話，將會造成社會混亂並且成為後續衝突的開端。 其中社會中長期的階級變動發展，便源自於剝削階級對勞動人民剝削的程度以及勞動人民對剝削階級依附的具體方式的變化。	5 ::: 5	思想 ::: 社會體制	4
2	Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones .	3 ::: 3 ::: 3	Thought ::: Philosophy and social thought ::: Economy, history and society	5	但儘管馬克思對於資本主義予以批判，並且針對應當取代資本主義的共產主義社會提出相關討論，不過馬克思對於資本主義的批判仍然極為謹慎，因為他認為與過去社會上的奴隸制度和封建制度相比改良許多缺失。	5 ::: 5	思想 ::: 社會體制	5

6	In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that "the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker"—a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone.	6	Presidency (1969–1974)	1	尼克松在就职演讲中表示：“历史能够赐予的最大荣誉就是和平缔造者的称号”，这场演讲获得几乎一致性的好评，这句话之后也将刻在他的墓碑上。	5	总统任期（1969至1974年）	1
6	He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:   In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.	6	Presidency (1969–1974)	2	他还在演说中谈到要把党派政治转变成一个团结的新时代：  在这些艰难的岁月里，美国已经充满夸张的言辞，这些膨胀的豪言壮语作出无法遵守的承诺，这些愤怒的说辞把球迷的不满变成仇恨，这些花言巧语给出的没有劝谕，只有夸夸其谈的姿态。	5	总统任期（1969至1974年）	2

6	As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the U.S. would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	0	根据尼克松主义外交方针，美国在可能的情况下将避免通过直接参战来对盟国提供援助，而是给予他们援助来令其拥有自卫的能力。 因此在尼克松担任总统期间，美国对中东地区的军售额度有大幅度增长，特别是以色列、伊朗和沙特阿拉伯。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	0
6	The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	1	尼克松政府对美国在中东的盟国以色列予以大力支持，但这样的支持不是无条件的。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	1

6	The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	3	他认为除了第二次中东战争以外，美国都未能干预以色列，所以应该使用加大美国军事援助作为杠杆敦促各方回到谈判桌前。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	3
6	The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	4	不过，阿以冲突并非尼克松第一个总统任期的主要关注议题，这其中的一个原因就是，他觉得无论自己怎么做，美国的犹太人都会反对他竞选连任。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	4

6	Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	6	尼克松立即下令向以色列空运最先进的飞机、坦克和导弹，规模超过50年代的“柏林空运”，并且绕开跨部门指挥的争吵和官僚作风，对阿拉伯国家可能采取的任何回应承担个人责任。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	6
6	More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	7	一个多星期后，当美国和苏联开始对停火展开谈判时，以色列已经反过来深入敌方领土。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	7

6	When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	9	勃列日涅夫也宣称要单方面强制执行维和军事任务，美国的间谍卫星还发现苏联红军的五个空降旅正在向中东地区调动，尼克松立即下令美国军队进入第三级戒备状态，所有美军人员和基地进入核战争警戒状态。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	9
6	This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	10	这是继古巴导弹危机以来，全世界爆发核战争最剑拔弩张的一次，最终勃列日涅夫面对尼克松的行为选择让步。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	10
6	Because Israel's victory was largely due to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., resulting in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.	6 ::: 1 ::: 5	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Foreign policy ::: Middle Eastern policy	11	石油输出国组织向美国实施的石油禁运导致第一次石油危机，美国于1973年后期出现汽油短缺，只能定量供应，不过在中东地区恢复和平后，石油生产油也取消禁运，石油危机随之结束。	5 ::: 1 ::: 5	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 对外政策 ::: 中东政策	11

6	The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	1	约翰逊总统在任时制定的伟大社会计划与越南战争的开销一起，造成庞大的预算赤字。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	1

6	This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections .	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	4	这不可能一蹴而就，所以美国经济的困苦挣扎一直持续到1970年，一定程度上加剧共和党在这年国会中期选举中的低迷表现，民主党得以在尼克松担任总统期间一直保持着对国会两院的控制权。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	4
6	According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	5	根据国民经济学家奈杰尔·鲍尔斯2011年对尼克松经济记录的研究，新总统上任第一年没有对约翰逊的政策作出多大改变。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	5
6	Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	6	与国内政策相比，尼克松对外交事务的兴趣要大得多，但他也相信选民会更关注自己的经济状况，因此会对自己竞选连任构成威胁。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	6
6	As part of his "New Federalism" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	7	作为他“新联邦主义”观点的一部分，尼克松提议向各州拨款，但这样提案大部分都在国会预算审议过程中被否决。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	7
6	However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	8	不过，尼克松也因提出这些提案而获得政治上的信誉。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	8
6	In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	9	1970年，国会授予总统权力干预工资和物价，不过拥有大多数席位的民主党人知道尼克松曾反对这样的管制，所以认为他即使拥有了这个权力也不会使用。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	9

6	Bowles points out,  by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents ... to criticize him. His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	12	鲍尔斯指出：“通过提出这样一项旨在降低通货膨胀的政策，尼克松给他的民主党对手留下难题……让他们无法批评他。因为总统提出的就是他们自己设计的政策，现在既然总统提出来了，他们即使不同意，也无法提供一个合理或可信的替代政策。”	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	12
6	Nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	13	尼克松的政策在1972年有效降低通胀率，但其余波也导致他的第二个任期甚至到福特上任后出现通胀。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	13
6	After Nixon won re-election, inflation was returning.	6 ::: 2 ::: 1	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Domestic policy ::: Economy	14	赢得连任后，尼克松发现通胀再度出现。	5 ::: 2 ::: 1	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 国内政策 ::: 经济	14
6	He reimposed price controls in June 1973.

He defended his record as president, quoting from Theodore Roosevelt's 1910 speech "Citizenship in a Republic":   Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, "whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly".	6 ::: 4 ::: 3	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Reelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation ::: Resignation	3	他接下来开始回顾自己担任总统期间的成就，特别是在外交政策方面，还引用西奥多·罗斯福1910年的演讲“共和国公民”来为自己辩护：   有时我成功了，有时我也会失败，但无论如何，我都一直谨记着西奥多·罗斯福对战场上武士的评价：“这些武士的脸上都混合着血泪和泥土；他们都英勇地活着，一遍又一遍地遭遇坎坷和错误，但是他们依然不畏失误，尽力去实践；他们懂得激情和付出，并把自己的生命奉献给有意义的事业；因为他们知道，成功迎来的将是无与伦比的高度，即使面临失败，也意味着他们有尝试的伟大勇气。”	5 ::: 4 ::: 3	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 连任与辞职 ::: 辞职	3

6	Black opined that "What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president, Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue.	6 ::: 4 ::: 3	Presidency (1969–1974) ::: Reelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation ::: Resignation	5	布莱克指出，“这本对于任何一位美国总统来说都将是前所未有的羞辱，但在缺乏足够法律支持的情况下，尼克松仍然将其转变成虚拟立法部门对他几乎无可指责的认可，一半的讲话里都是在朗诵自己任期内取得的成就。”	5 ::: 4 ::: 3	总统任期（1969至1974年） ::: 连任与辞职 ::: 辞职	5

23	Of the books, "Purgatorio" is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referring to more contemporary poets and artists than "Inferno"; "Paradiso" is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the "Divine Comedy"'s most beautiful and mystic passages appear .	3	Works	1	天堂的描述對現代人而言相當的生動，而其他部份表露神學上的細微之處，需要讀者有相當的耐心及知識才能理解。 其中煉獄篇是三篇中最抒情的，其中也穿插著大量的詩，天堂篇的神學性最強，也有最美麗及最欣喜若狂的內容，其中有些是但丁承認他無法表達	2	作品	1
23	With its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range—both stylistic and thematic—of its content, the "Comedy" soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language.	3	Works	2	由於嚴肅的目的，文學地位及其範圍，《神曲》成為義大利文學發展的一個重要基石。	2	作品	2
23	Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers.	3	Works	3	但丁比其他早期的義大利作家更了解義大利方言，也知道需要有創造一個統一的文字及語言，超過當時拉丁文的的限制。 在這個層面上，但丁是文藝復興的先驅，在平民文學上可以和早期的古典作家相比。	2	作品	3
23	Dante's in-depth knowledge  of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century.	3	Works	4	但丁對古羅馬的了解，以及他對古羅馬一些異教層面的欽佩，也影響了十五世紀。	2	作品	4
23	Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the "Comedy" slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.	3	Works	5	諷刺的是，在他死後的幾世紀後，《神曲》不再受到文人墨客的歡迎，太中古時期、太粗糙及悲慘，也不是文藝復興時期大家期待看到的文學。	2	作品	5
23	He wrote the "Comedy" in a language he called "Italian", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.	3	Works	6	但丁將他寫作《神曲》用的語言稱為「義大利文」，主要是以托斯卡尼的地區性方言為主，但也加上拉丁文和其他地區性的方言。	2	作品	6
23	He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets.	3	Works	7	他特意希望包括一般人、神職人員或是其他詩人都可以讀他的史詩。	2	作品	7
23	By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression.	3	Works	8	為了創造史詩的結構及複雜的目的，但丁創作了義大利文。	2	作品	8
23	In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed "la langue de Dante".	3	Works	9	在法國，義大利文有時會戲稱為「但丁的語言」。	2	作品	9
23	Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in Roman Catholic Western Europe  to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin .	3	Works	10	但丁用平民語言出版《神曲》，和傑弗里·喬叟及喬萬尼·薄伽丘一起成為早期不使用拉丁文出版的先驅之一。	2	作品	10
23	This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future.	3	Works	11	這項突破使得更多文學作品可以針對許多的讀者出版。	2	作品	11
23	However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era.	3	Works	12	不過和喬萬尼·薄伽丘、約翰·密爾頓或阿里奧斯托不同，但丁在浪漫時期前不是全歐洲著名的作者。	2	作品	12
23	To the Romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the "original genius" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated.	3	Works	13	在浪漫時期時，但丁和莎士比亞一樣，是標準的「原創天才」，設定自己的規則，創造有地位和深度的角色，超過以往的作家，也不是其他作家可以模仿的。	2	作品	13
23	Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.	3	Works	14	在十九世紀時但丁的名聲越加穩固，在1865年時．他已成為西方世界最偉大的文學家之一。	2	作品	14

32	In order to solve what had become known in some circles as "Gordan's Problem", Hilbert realized that it was necessary to take a completely different path.

32	Hilbert sent his results to the "Mathematische Annalen". Gordan, the house expert on the theory of invariants for the "Mathematische Annalen", could not appreciate the revolutionary nature of Hilbert's theorem and rejected the article, criticizing the exposition because it was insufficiently comprehensive.

82	The welcome accorded to ousted claimants of the Hungarian throne in Constantinople was seen by the Byzantines as a useful insurance policy and source of political leverage.

82	Yet resistance, particularly from the Danishmends of the northeast, was strong, and the difficult nature of holding the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by the Turks even as John was in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule.	6 ::: 4	Military exploits ::: War of attrition against the Anatolian Turks (1119-20, 1130-35, 1139-1140)	10	然而，在东北方达尼什曼德王朝的强大威胁下，这些难以防守的新占领区如卡斯塔莫努甚至在约翰还在君士坦丁堡庆祝它光复时就被突厥人重新占领了。	2 ::: 2 ::: 4	对外 ::: 军事功绩 ::: 与安纳托利亚突厥人的消耗战	10

82	John is recorded as citing two main reasons for choosing Manuel over his older brother Isaac: Isaac's irascibility, and the courage that Manuel had shown on campaign at Neocaesareia.	7	Death and succession	3	约翰选择曼努埃尔而非其兄长Isaac Komnenos 有两条有记载的证据：伊萨克的脾气易怒，并且曼努埃尔的胆识已经在尼克萨尔战役中显现了出来。	4	去世与继任者	3
82	Another theory alleges that the reason for this choice was the AIMA prophecy, which foretold that John's successor should be one whose name began with an "M".	7	Death and succession	4	另一个证据据称是源自AIMA预言的选择，它预言约翰的继承人名字的首字母应该是“M"。约翰二世的挚友约翰·阿克苏赫，尽管有记载他苦劝垂死的皇帝，伊萨克·科穆宁才是更合适的继承人，但还是在确保曼努埃尔·科穆宁获得皇权不受任何公开挑战上做出了贡献。	4	去世与继任者	4
82	Fittingly, John's close friend John Axouch, although he is recorded as having tried hard to persuade the dying emperor that Isaac was the better candidate to succeed, was instrumental in ensuring that Manuel's assumption of power was free from any overt opposition.	7	Death and succession	5	拉丁史学家威廉形容约翰二世不仅身材矮小而且相貌是不寻常得丑陋。	5	外貌与性格	0

82	According to this view, John's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire's heartland, which lacked reliable borders, while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor.	8	The legacy of John II	3	他的演讲风格严肃却又不乏幽默风趣的巧妙辩驳。 对于他的孩子们他是一位慈爱的父亲，而且给他的孩子们制定了很高的标准，对于他的妻子他也是一位忠诚的丈夫。	5	外貌与性格	4
82	The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Holy Roman Emperor against the Normans of Sicily.	8	The legacy of John II	4	尽管他的个人生活非常简朴，但他认为推崇华丽的仪式有利于彰显帝国的强盛。	5	外貌与性格	5
82	Overall, it is clear that John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it.	8	The legacy of John II	5	这些举措使得他受到了他的臣民极高的尊重。	5	外貌与性格	6
82	By the time of his death substantial territories had been recovered, and the goals of the recovery of control over central Anatolia and the re-establishment of a frontier on the Euphrates seemed achievable.	8	The legacy of John II	6	约翰当时曾因他的虔诚与和善而闻名，在那个残忍的时代中他被认为是一位仁慈的统治者。	5	外貌与性格	7
82	However, the Greeks of the interior of Anatolia were becoming increasingly accustomed to Turkish rule and often found it preferable to that of Byzantium.	8	The legacy of John II	7	他因他从不处死或致残任何人而驰名。 他还慷慨的投入到慈善事业中。	5	外貌与性格	8
82	Also, though it was relatively easy to extract submission and admissions of vassalage from the Anatolian Turks, Serbs and Crusader States of the Levant, converting these relationships into concrete gains for the security of the Empire had proven elusive.	8	The legacy of John II	8	因此被称作是拜占庭的马可·奥勒留。 受他的高尚的品格与宗教虔诚的影响礼仪仪式在他的时代获得了巨大的发展。	5	外貌与性格	9
82	These problems were left for his gifted and mercurial son, Manuel, to attempt to solve.	8	The legacy of John II	9	在战斗中也可以表现出他极高的自制力与勇气，透过他数次指挥军队保卫帝国的表现来看，在战场上他是一位十分杰出的军事家。	5	外貌与性格	10

84	The changes Epaminondas wrought on the Greek political order did not long outlive him, as the cycle of shifting hegemonies and alliances continued unabated. A mere twenty-seven years after his death, a recalcitrant Thebes was obliterated by Alexander the Great.	0	Overview	5	其為希臘所創造的新政治秩序並不比其長壽很多，底比斯的霸權與其創立的同盟並不持久，在其死後27年，底比斯便被亞歷山大大帝消滅。	0	Overview	5
84	Thus Epaminondas&mdash;who had been praised in his time as an idealist and liberator&mdash;is today largely remembered for a decade  of campaigning that sapped the strength of the great city-states and paved the way for the Macedonian conquest.	0	Overview	6	所以伊巴密濃達雖然在其時代被認為是一位理想主義者與解放者，但在今天，人們大多只記得其十年戰事大大地削弱了希臘的元氣，使希臘在其後無法抵抗馬其頓的進攻，並且被其征服。	0	Overview	6
84	The life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries (e.g. Philip II of Macedon, Pelopidas).	1	Historical sources	0	雖然伊巴密濃達在其身處的時代極其重要，但關於其本人的史料卻乏善足陳，不論古代或現代學者皆不能勾畫其完整生平。	1	歷史上的伊巴密濃達	0
84	One principal reason for this is the loss of Plutarch's biography of him. Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by Plutarch in his "Parallel Lives", in which he is paired with the Roman statesman Scipio Africanus; however, both these ""Lives"" are now lost.	1	Historical sources	1	而其著名的事蹟大多由古羅馬歷史學家內波斯、希臘旅行家及地理學家保薩尼阿斯、希臘哲學家普魯塔克、希臘歷史學家狄奧多羅斯與色諾芬的著作裡得出，但並不是所有著作皆存留至現在。	1	歷史上的伊巴密濃達	1

84	There is also a surviving  biography of Epaminondas by the Roman author Cornelius Nepos from the first century BC which, in the absence of Plutarch's, becomes a major source for Epaminondas's life.	1	Historical sources	3	普魯塔克曾寫過關於伊巴密濃達的生平記述，但現已遺失；然而部份關於伊巴密濃達的資料可以由其記述底比斯的政治家和將軍派洛皮德與斯巴達國王阿格西勞斯二世的著作裡得到。	1	歷史上的伊巴密濃達	3
84	The period of Greek history from 411-362 BC is primarily attested by the historian Xenophon, who evidently saw his work as continuation of Thucydides's "History of the Peloponnesian War". Xenophon, who idolized Sparta and its king, Agesilaus, avoids mentioning Epaminondas wherever possible and does not even note his presence at the Battle of Leuctra.	1	Historical sources	4	在當時史學家的記述裡，狄奧多羅斯的著作保留了少量資料，而色諾芬，即那位將斯巴達與其國王阿格西勞斯二世神化的史學家則盡量避免提到伊巴密濃達，即使在有關留克特拉戰役的記述裡亦沒提到伊巴密濃達。	1	歷史上的伊巴密濃達	4
84	Epaminondas's role in the conflicts of the 4th century is also described by Diodorus Siculus, in his "Bibliotheca historica".	1	Historical sources	5	此外，並不是所有提到伊巴密濃達的古代文獻皆是可信的。	1	歷史上的伊巴密濃達	5
84	Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there as part of a Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.	2	Early life	0	在前385年，曼蒂尼亞附近的一次小衝突裡，伊巴密濃達冒著生命危險，救出了其日後最重要的戰友派洛皮德，這使得兩人成為管鮑之交，在日後的戰鬥裡生死與共。	2	年輕時代、教育與個人生活	0
84	According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus; the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle.

84	Certainly, he served with the Theban armies in the defence of Boeotia in the 370s, and, by 371 BC, he had become a Boeotarch.

84	During the course of the battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	6	在戰役前伊巴密濃達為其部隊作了創新的編制，這在以前的希臘世界的戰爭裡未嘗見過。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	6
84	Traditionally, a phalanx therefore lined up for battle with the elite troops on the right flank to counter this tendency.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	7	傳統上，各個戰鬥方陣會排成一橫線，而且集精銳於右翼。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	7
84	Thus, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the elite 'Spartiates' were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian allies were on the left.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	8	因此，斯巴達王克勒姆布羅托將其斯巴達精銳部隊與其同置於右翼，而裝備較弱的伯羅奔尼撒同盟軍則被置於左翼。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	8
84	However, needing to counter the Spartans' numerical advantage, Epaminondas implemented two tactical innovations.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	9	為了對抗擁有數量優勢的斯巴達大軍，伊巴密濃達作出了兩個軍事創新。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	9
84	Firstly, he took the best troops in the army, and arranged them 50 ranks deep  on the "left" wing, opposite Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extreme left flank.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	10	首先，將其與其統率的底比斯軍置於左翼，並將派洛皮德統率的精銳部隊聖隊置於左翼鋒面。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	10
84	Secondly, recognizing, that he could not have matched the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx , he abandoned all attempts to do so.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	11	其次，由於其無法在不將列數減少的情況下排出與斯巴達軍相同長度的陣形，因此放棄嘗試排出與斯巴達相同長度陣形。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	11
84	The battle then became general, with the strengthened Theban left flank marching to attack at double speed, while the right flank retreated.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	12	當戰事開始時，其加強了的左翼以雙倍速度衝向斯巴達軍，而較弱的右翼則後撤並延遲戰鬥。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	12
84	After intense fighting, the Spartan right flank began to give way under the impetus of the mass of Thebans, and Cleombrotus was killed.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	13	這戰鬥法是受到另一位底比斯將軍帕戈恩蘇在第力安會戰裡以二十五列縱深的攻勢大敗雅典軍的啟發。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	13
84	Although the Spartans held on for long enough to rescue the body of the king, their line was soon broken by the sheer force of the Theban assault.	3 ::: 2 ::: 4	Political and military career ::: Early career ::: Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)	14	然而這新式戰鬥法仍為伊巴密濃達首創，這就是著名的斜線式戰術。	4 ::: 2	前371年 ::: 留克特拉戰役	14

104	In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	7	在这篇文章中，海森堡避免了雖具体但不可观测的關於电子轨道的表述，而改用像是必須採用两个脚标表示跃迁前后状态的跃迁概率，來表述量子理论。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	7
104	When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	8	在玻恩阅读论文的过程中，他看出海森堡的理论可以利用他曾学过的矩阵表述。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	8
104	Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	9	矩阵在那个时代很少被物理学家用到，而常被视为属于纯数学范畴。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	9

104	With the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, Born began immediately to make a transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg's paper.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	12	在他的助手帕斯库尔·约当的协助下，玻恩在不久后即开始改写并扩展海森堡的理论，并在海森堡文章发表60天后发表了他们的结果。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	12
104	A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	13	随后在該年結束前，三人又联合发表了一篇文章。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	13
104	The result was a surprising formulation:  : p q - q p =   I   where "p" and "q" were matrices for location and momentum, and "I" is the identity matrix.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	14	结果有著以下驚人的公式：  : p q - q p =   I   式中，"p"和"q"分别是代表位置与动量的矩阵，"I"是单位矩阵。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	14
104	Note that the left hand side of the equation is not zero because matrix multiplication is not commutative.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	15	会有如此結果，是因为矩阵乘法并不遵守交换律。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	15
104	This formulation was entirely attributable to Born, who also established that all the elements not on the diagonal of the matrix were zero.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	16	此式完全歸功於玻恩，他發現不在對角線上的元素全都是零。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	16
104	Born considered that his paper with Jordan contained "the most important principles of quantum mechanics including its extension to electrodynamics."	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	17	玻恩认为他与约当合写的文章包含了“量子力学與其电动力学之延伸中最为重要的原理”。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	17
104	The paper put Heisenberg's approach on a solid mathematical basis.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	18	同时，这篇文章也为海森堡的方法奠定了坚实的数学基础。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	18
104	Born was surprised to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	19	此时，狄拉克也在沿着与海森堡类似的思路发展量子理论。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	19

104	Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schr?dinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This had a great deal of appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	21	埃尔温·薛定谔也做出了重要的貢獻，尋求波动力学的問題，这在當時有著大量的訴求，因為這可能会回到经典物理的决定论。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	21
104	Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	22	玻恩却并不认为如此，因为這与实验事实并不吻合。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	22
104	He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ In a letter to Born on 4 December 1926, Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics: Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	23	1926年7月，他为薛定谔方程中的ψ 在爱因斯坦1926年12月4日写给玻恩的信中，他对量子力学做了著名的评述：  量子力学固然是堂皇的。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	23
104	But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	24	可是有一种内在的声音告诉我，它还不是那真实的东西。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	24
104	The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the 'old one'.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	25	这理论说得很多，但是並没有真的帶領我们更加接近于“上帝”的秘密。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	25
104	I, at any rate, am convinced that "He" is not playing at dice.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	26	我无论如何相信「他」不是在掷骰子。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	26
104	This quotation is often paraphrased as 'God does not play dice'.	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	27	这段话常被引用为“上帝不掷骰子”。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	27
104	In 1928, Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics,  but Heisenberg alone won the 1932 Prize "for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen", while Schr?dinger and Dirac shared the 1933 Prize "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory".	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	28	1928年，爱因斯坦提名了海森堡、玻恩和约当作为诺贝尔物理学奖候选人。 但海森堡獨自在1932年因“创建量子力学及其在发现氢的同素异形体中的应用”获奖，而薛定谔与狄拉克也在1933年因“发现原子理论新的有用形式”共同获奖。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	28
104	On 25 November 1933, Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a "bad conscience" that he alone had received the Prize "for work done in G?ttingen in collaboration — you, Jordan and I."	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	29	1933年11月25日，玻恩受到了海森堡的来信。 海森堡写到他对于自己一人得奖“问心有愧”，“因为工作是在哥廷根合作完成的——您，约旦和我”。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	29
104	Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan's contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by "a wrong decision from the outside."	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	30	海森堡接着说玻恩和约当对于量子力学的贡献不会被“来自外界错误的决定”改变。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	30
104	In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honouring Planck for his insight in 1900, in which he credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not "adequately acknowledged in the public eye."	2 ::: 2	Career ::: G?ttingen	31	1954年，海森堡在撰写一篇向普朗克致敬的文章中，将矩阵力学数学表述的最终成型归功于玻恩和约当。 他在其中强调了他们对于量子力学的功劳之大，但“却没有被公众充分认识到”。	3 ::: 2	研究生涯 ::: 哥廷根	31

122	In 1906, Marshall declined his party's nomination to run for Congress. He hinted, however, to state party leaders that he would be interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	0	1906年，马歇尔谢绝党派竞选国会议员的邀请，但也向州内民主党领导人暗示自己有意在1908年竞选州长。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	0
122	He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the "Indianapolis Star".	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	1	他很快就取得多个重要工会的支持，《印第安纳波利斯星报》的一名记者也公开表态赞成马歇尔出任州长。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	1
122	Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	2	但是，在州民主党大会上，他仍然是黑马候选人。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	2
122	Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	3	马歇尔支持禁酒，这招致党魁托马斯·塔格特的反感。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	3
122	Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	4	塔格特希望党派提名反对禁酒的塞缪尔·罗尔斯顿，但禁酒派和反对塔格特的派系同马歇尔的支持者联合起来，确保他赢得党派提名。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	4
122	Marshall's opponent in the general election was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	5	马歇尔在普选中的对手是共和党联邦众议员詹姆斯·E·沃森，禁酒成为竞选的主要议题。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	5
122	Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	6	就在竞选开始前，共和党控制的州政府通过法律，授权县级地方政府禁止酒类商品销售。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	6
122	The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	7	这项法律成为不同党派及其州长候选人的争议焦点。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	7
122	The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	8	民主党人提议修改法案，允许各市、镇政府自行决定是否禁止酒类经营。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	8
122	This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	9	共和党则主张全面禁酒，相比之下，反禁酒派自然支持民主党的方案，期望以此为突破口，在部分地区放开销售限制。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	9
122	The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it.	2 ::: 1	Governorship ::: Campaign	10	民主党的倡议还可以确保那些大部分人支持禁酒的社区可以自行立法禁酒，所以原本禁酒派的支持也得以保留。	2 ::: 1	印第安纳州州长 ::: 竞选	10

122	Since his party had been out of power for many years, its initial objective was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	1	由于民主党已连续数十年在野，因此新政府的首要目标就是尽可能多地把民主党人安排到重要权利岗位。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	1
122	Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	2	马歇尔力图避免直接参与此事，默许党派内的不同派系取得相应官职，自行决断的人选非常少。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	2
122	He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	3	他允许塔格特安排及挑选官员人选，自己再在正式任命文件上签名。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	3
122	Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	4	这种做法虽然得以避免党派内部出现重大分歧，但也导致马歇尔无法建立强有力的政治根基。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	4
122	During his term, Marshall focused primarily on advancing the progressive agenda.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	5	担任州长期间，马歇尔的关注重点是推进进步主义议程。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	5
122	He successfully advocated the passage of a child labor law and anti-corruption legislation.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	6	在他的倡导下，印第安纳州通过童工和反腐败法律。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	6
122	He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	7	他支持以普选推举联邦参议员，相应的联邦宪法修正案就是在他担任州长期间由州议会批准。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	7
122	He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	8	他还大力整顿州审计部门，声称为政府省下数百万美元。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	8
122	Marshall was a strong opponent of Indiana's recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	9	马歇尔极力反对印第安纳州之前不久通过的优生法和绝育法，并下令州政府机构不得遵循这些法律。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	9
122	He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	10	他是美国最早同优生法公开对抗的政治家之一，这种反对立场之后也一直伴随他的副总统任期。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	10
122	His governorship was the first in which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	11	马歇尔还反对死刑，对州内所有即将执行死刑的犯人给予减刑或赦免，印第安纳州为此首次出现整个州长任期内没有执行死刑的情况。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	11
122	He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses.	2 ::: 2	Governorship ::: Progressive agenda	12	他经常拿企业开刀，并多次试图通过新的反托拉斯法拆分大型企业。 担任州长期间，马歇尔参加过多次礼仪活动，1909年印第安纳波利斯赛车场竣工时，正是他亲自铺下最后一块金块。	2 ::: 2	印第安纳州州长 ::: 进步主义议程	12
122	Rewriting the state constitution became Marshall's central focus as governor, and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he began to seek alternative means by which to have a new constitution adopted.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	0	改写州宪法成为马歇尔州长任期的关注重点，州议会拒绝召开制宪大会后，他开始寻求其它手段来通过新宪法。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	0
122	He and Jacob Piatt Dunn, a close friend and civic leader, wrote a new constitution that increased the state's regulatory powers considerably, set minimum wages, and gave constitutional protections to unions.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	1	公民领袖雅各布·皮亚特·邓恩与马歇尔私交甚佳，两人一起草拟出新宪法草案，在其中大幅增强州政府的监管权，同时定下最低薪资标准，还对工会提供宪法保护。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	1
122	Many of these reforms were also in the Socialist Party platform under its leader, Terre Haute native Eugene V. Debs.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	2	这些改革项目有许多同社会党的党纲不谋而合，特雷霍特政治家尤金·V·德布斯是该党的领导人。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	2
122	Republicans believed Marshall's constitution was an attempt to win over Debs' supporters, who had a strong presence in Indiana.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	3	德布斯的支持者在印第安纳州占相当比例，共和党人因此认为马歇尔提出新宪法是要拉拢这些选民。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	3
122	The 1910 mid-term elections gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate, increasing the constitution's chances of being adopted.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	4	经过1910年的中期选举，民主党又控制了州参议院，新宪法通过的几率进一步提高。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	4
122	Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	5	马歇尔于1911年正式将草案递交州议会，建议在1912年选举时交由选民表决。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	5
122	Republicans opposed the ratification process, and were infuriated that the Democrats were attempting to revise the entire constitution without calling a constitutional convention, as had been called for in the state's two previous constitutions.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	6	印第安纳州此前两稿州宪法都是通过制宪会议制定，共和党人因此反对通过全民公决来批准新宪法，并对民主党人试图在不召开制宪会议的情况下重写整个宪法感到出离愤怒。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	6
122	Republicans took the issue to court and the Marion County Circuit Court granted an injunction removing the constitution from the 1912 ballot.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	7	共和党向法院提出诉状，马里昂县巡回法院颁布禁制令，取消1912年公决中的宪法草案。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	7
122	Marshall appealed, but the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the decision in a judgment which stated that the Constitution of Indiana could not be replaced in total without a constitutional convention, based on the precedent set by Indiana's first two constitutions.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	8	马歇尔提出上诉，但州最高法院维持原判，理由是根据之前两版宪法的先例，州宪法不能在没有召开制宪会议的情况下全盘改写。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	8
122	Marshall was angry with the decision and delivered a speech attacking the court and accusing it of overstepping its authority.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	9	马歇尔对这一结果感到愤怒，并发表演说指责法院越权。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	9
122	He launched a final appeal to the United States Supreme Court but left office in January 1913 while the case was still pending.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	10	他最终向联邦最高法院发出最后一次上诉，但到他于1913年1月离任时，法院仍然没有做出裁决。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	10
122	Later that year, the court declined the appeal, finding that the issue was within the sole jurisdiction of the state courts. Marshall was disappointed with the outcome.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	11	几个月后，联邦最高法院认定此案完全属州法院管辖范围，因此没有接受马歇尔的上诉，他对此深感失望。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	11
122	Subsequent scholars such as Linda Gugin and legal expert James St. Claire have called the process and the document "seriously flawed" and argued that had the constitution been adopted, large parts would probably have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts.	2 ::: 3	Governorship ::: Marshall's constitution	12	之后，包括琳达·古金教授在内的多位历史学家认为，无论是马歇尔倡导的宪法本身，还是他寄希望通过新宪法的方式都存在“不可救药的硬伤”，法学专家詹姆斯·圣克莱尔指出，即使马歇尔的宪法得以通过，很可能之后也会被联邦法院裁定违宪。	2 ::: 3	印第安纳州州长 ::: 马歇尔的宪法	12
122	The Indiana constitution prevented Marshall from serving a consecutive term as governor.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	0	根据印第安纳州宪法的规定，州长不得连任。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	0
122	He made plans to run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	1	马歇尔原计划在卸任后竞选联邦参议员，但就在担任州长的最后1个月里，另一个机会送上门来。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	1
122	Although he did not attend the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, his name was put forward as Indiana's choice for president.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	2	虽然马歇尔没有出席1912年在巴尔的摩召开的民主党全国大会，但印第安纳州代表团还是推举他作为总统候选人。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	2
122	He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark, securing the nomination for Wilson.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	3	马歇尔本是用于调和各派系的折中候选人，但在威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩及其支持者的推动下，伍德罗·威尔逊战胜查普·克拉克获提名。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	3
122	Indiana's delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	4	印第安纳州代表团于是转为要求提名马歇尔竞选副总统，承诺会在选举中支持威尔逊。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	4
122	Indiana was an important swing state, and Wilson hoped that Marshall's popularity would help him carry it in the general election.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	5	印第安纳州是当时美国大选中的关键摇摆州，威尔逊也希望马歇尔担任州长期间积累的声望能够帮助他赢得普选，因此指示支持者把票投给马歇尔，后者于是成为威尔逊的竞选搭档。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	5
122	He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the job would be boring given its limited role.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	6	马歇尔觉得副总统的作用非常有限，这份工作可能会很无趣，所以私下里曾谢绝这次提名，	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	6
122	He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	7	但在威尔逊亲自保证副总统会有充分职责后改变了主意。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	7
122	Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he disagreed with him on a number of issues.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	8	马歇尔同威尔逊在多个议题上存在分歧，所以无法得到总统赏识。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	8
122	Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly.	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	9	虽然威尔逊曾邀请副总统出席内阁会议，但马歇尔的看法大多沦为空谷回音，之后他也不再定期参加这些会议。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	9
122	In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, "I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world".	3 ::: 1	Vice presidency ::: Election	10	马歇尔的回忆录中对威尔逊的负面评价只有一句：“我有时觉得，伟人都会祸害文明，他们正是这个世界上所有苦果和争斗的真正原因”。	3 ::: 1	美国副总统 ::: 选举	10
122	Marshall was not offended by Wilson's lack of interest in his ideas, and considered his primary constitutional duty to be in the Senate.  He viewed the vice presidential office as being in the legislative branch, not the executive.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	0	马歇尔并不介意威尔逊毫不重视他的观念，认为自己主要的宪法职责是主持参议院运作，把副总统职位视为立法分支而非行政分支的组成部分。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	0
122	While he presided in the Senate, emotions sometimes ran high, including during a debate on the Mexican border crisis in 1916. During that debate Marshall threatened to expel certain senators from the chamber for their raucous behavior, but did not carry through on the threat.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	1	主持参议院议事时，马歇尔偶尔会有情绪激动的时刻。1916年参议院讨论墨西哥边境危机期间，马歇尔曾威胁要把某些在现场喧哗的参议员赶出去，只是最后并没有兑现。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	1
122	On several occasions, he ordered the Senate gallery cleared.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	2	另外，他还曾多次下令参议院旁听席清场。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	2
122	In the debates leading up to World War I, a number of isolationist senators filibustered bills that Wilson considered important.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	3	就美国是否加入第一次世界大战展开辩论期间，多名信奉孤立主义的参议员通过冗长辩论来阻止对威尔逊而言非常重要的法案通过。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	3
122	The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	4	这样的冗长辩论持续时间长达数周，其中还有两次超过3个月。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	4
122	Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	5	威尔逊及法案的部分支持者要求马歇尔发出禁言令来减短这类辩论，但副总统出于道德角度考量拒绝执行，多项法案因此未能通过，只能希望这部分议员会自愿停止阻挠。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	5
122	Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	6	未通过的法案中有一项允许商船自行武装，还有一项允许联邦政府直接向盟国销售军火。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	6
122	Despite their victories, the small group of senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	7	但是，胜利并未令这一部分参议员放松警惕，他们继续阻挠任何倾向支持战争的法案通过。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	7
122	In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	8	面对这种情况，参议院在马歇尔的引领下于1917年3月8日通过新议事规则，规定如到场投票的参议员中有三分之二支持，就不得继续冗长辩论。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	8
122	This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	9	而在以往的规则下，任何参议员都可以把辩论按意愿无限期延长。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	9
122	The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of "all" Senators, not only the ones voting.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	10	此后，这项规则又经过多次调整，现行规则是“所有”参议员的五分之三投票支持，而不仅仅是投票参议员的多数支持。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	10
122	As Marshall made little news and was viewed as a somewhat comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor, a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the 1916 reelection ticket.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	11	由于马歇尔的第一个任期波澜不惊，还因其幽默感而被视为首都的喜剧人物，因此有部分民主党领袖打算另觅人选取代他参加1916年大选。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	11
122	Wilson, after deliberating, decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity; thus in 1916 Marshall won reelection over the still divided Republican Party and became the first vice president re-elected since John C. Calhoun in 1828, and Wilson and Marshall became the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820.	3 ::: 2	Vice presidency ::: Senate developments	12	威尔逊经过考虑后决定让马歇尔竞选连任，以证明党派团结。 两人在大选中再度战胜分裂的共和党，马歇尔成为1828年的约翰·卡德威尔·卡尔霍恩后首位取得连任的副总统，并同威尔逊一起成为1820年的门罗和汤普金斯后首位连任总统和副总统。	3 ::: 2	美国副总统 ::: 主持参议院运作	12
122	On the evening of July 2, 1915, Eric Muenter, a onetime German professor at Harvard and Cornell universities, who opposed American support of the allied war effort, broke into the U.S. Senate and, finding the door to the Senate chamber locked, laid dynamite outside the reception room, which happened to be next to Marshall's office door.	3 ::: 3	Vice presidency ::: Assassination attempt	0	1915年7月2日晚，曾在哈佛大学和康乃爾大學担任德语教授的无政府主义者埃里克·蒙特因反对美国在一战中支持同盟国而潜入联邦参议院楼层，在马歇尔的办公室大门周围埋下定时炸弹。	3 ::: 3	美国副总统 ::: 遭遇暗杀	0

122	On July 3, Muenter  burst into the Glen Cove, New York home of Jack Morgan, son of financier J.P. Morgan, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the allies.	3 ::: 3	Vice presidency ::: Assassination attempt	2	7月5日，蒙特又来到纽约州长岛北岸的格伦科夫，冲到约翰·皮尔庞特·摩根的儿子杰克·摩根家里，要求他停止向盟国销售武器。	3 ::: 3	美国副总统 ::: 遭遇暗杀	2
122	Morgan told the man he was in no position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice non-fatally and escaped.	3 ::: 3	Vice presidency ::: Assassination attempt	3	摩根告诉对方，自己在此事上根本做不了主，结果蒙特向他连开两枪后逃跑。	3 ::: 3	美国副总统 ::: 遭遇暗杀	3
122	Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it.	3 ::: 3	Vice presidency ::: Assassination attempt	4	蒙特被捕后承认自己曾试图暗杀副总统，马歇尔事后本可获私人安保队保护，但他谢绝了。	3 ::: 3	美国副总统 ::: 遭遇暗杀	4
122	During Marshall's second term, the United States entered World War I.  Marshall was a reluctant supporter of the war, believing the country to be unprepared and feared it would be necessary to enact conscription.	3 ::: 4	Vice presidency ::: World War I	0	美国在马歇尔的第二个副总统任期里加入第一次世界大战，他对参战的支持非常勉强，担心政府会不得不实行征兵制，美国也的确在宣战后不久就开始征兵。	3 ::: 4	美国副总统 ::: 第一次世界大战	0
122	He was pleased with Wilson's strategy to begin a military buildup before the declaration of war, and fully supported the war effort once it had begun.	3 ::: 4	Vice presidency ::: World War I	1	他对威尔逊在宣战前构建军备的策略非常满意，并且在宣战后全力支持国家赢得战争。	3 ::: 4	美国副总统 ::: 第一次世界大战	1

122	However, he was largely excluded from war planning and rarely received official updates on the progress of military campaigns.	3 ::: 4	Vice presidency ::: World War I	3	但是，他很大程度上还是无法参与作战计划的审订，也很少通过官方途径获悉战事进展，大部分情况下只能从报纸上查阅有关战争的新闻。	3 ::: 4	美国副总统 ::: 第一次世界大战	3
122	In most instances he received news of the war through the newspapers.	3 ::: 4	Vice presidency ::: World War I	4	威尔逊派马歇尔到全美各地发表鼓舞士气的讲话，鼓励美国民众购买自由债卷支援战争。	3 ::: 4	美国副总统 ::: 第一次世界大战	4

122	She and Marshall had been unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told her that she could "keep him, provided he did not squall".	3 ::: 5	Vice presidency ::: Morrison	3	马歇尔夫妇一直没有子女，所以她把孩子带回家时，马歇尔告诉太太，可以“把他留下来抚养，让他无需再不断啼哭……”副总统之后逐渐喜欢上这个孩子，他在回忆录中称克拉伦斯的到来仿佛一剂定心丸，从此他走在首都的街道上都感到无比心安。	3 ::: 5	美国副总统 ::: 莫里森	3
122	Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he "never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart", and, as the boy grew older, that he was "beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint".	3 ::: 5	Vice presidency ::: Morrison	4	随着孩子渐渐长大，马歇尔又称赞他“就像天使般美丽，拥有超过他年龄的天份，从任何角度看都那么可爱”。	3 ::: 5	美国副总统 ::: 莫里森	4

122	President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, "With congratulations to the baby. Wilson".	3 ::: 5	Vice presidency ::: Morrison	7	总统威尔逊觉得有义务认可莫里森是副总统夫妇的子嗣，所以他给马歇尔夫妇寄去便条，上面只有一句话：“祝贺添丁，威尔逊。”	3 ::: 5	美国副总统 ::: 莫里森	7
122	President Wilson experienced a mild stroke in September 1919.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	0	1919年9月，威尔逊总统经历了一次中度中风。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	0
122	On October 2, he was struck by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	1	10月2日，他又出现一次中风，并且程度要比上次严重得多，导致他部分瘫痪，几乎肯定无法再行使总统职责。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	1

122	Wilson's wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his "uncouthed" disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	3	威尔逊的妻子伊迪丝认为马歇尔性情“粗野”并对之非常反感，所以也反对他继任。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	3
122	Tumulty and the First Lady believed that an official communication from Wilson's staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	4	图穆提和第一夫人认为，如果威尔逊的幕僚在正式渠道提及总统病情，马歇尔就可以启动宪法机制继任总统，因此在白宫下达禁言令。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	4
122	After Marshall demanded to know Wilson's status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from the "Baltimore Sun" brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	5	马歇尔得知总统中风后要求知晓病情，以便做继任总统的相关准备，白宫于是安排《巴尔的摩太阳报》的一名记者转告副总统，威尔逊已命在旦夕。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	5
122	Marshall later said that "it was the first great shock of my life", but without an official communication on Wilson's condition, he didn't believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	6	马歇尔之后表示，“这是我一生中听到的最令我震惊的消息”，但由于没有正式的消息来源，他觉得自己不能根据宪法继任总统职位。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	6
122	On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was the first official to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	7	10月5日，国务卿罗伯特·蓝辛成为第一个提出由马歇尔强制就任总统职务的政府官员。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	7

122	Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting with his wife and his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	9	面对他们的示好，副总统的态度非常谨慎，同夫人和长期私人顾问马克·塞斯尔维特商议后，他私下表示拒绝接手总统职权，也不愿担任美国代总统。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	9
122	The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	10	宣布总统丧失行使职权能力的具体程序当时还不明确，马歇尔担心强行罢免威尔逊之举会定下影响非常恶劣的先例。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	10
122	Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	11	他希望总统自愿将权力移交副总统，但考虑到威尔逊的病情以及对马歇尔的态度，这显然是不可能的。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	11
122	Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	12	马歇尔告知内阁，除非国会两院通过联合决议，亦或威尔逊及其幕僚经正式渠道宣布总统无法履行职责，否则副总统不会继任。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	12
122	Wilson was kept secluded by his wife and personal physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	13	经第一夫人和总统私人医生的安排，威尔逊一直在静养，只有他的亲密助手可以前去面见，这些人都不会透露他的病情。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	13
122	Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, he was unable to do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	14	马歇尔曾试图面见威尔逊，希望能借此亲自确认总统病情，但这显然也无法做到，以致他只能通过总统医生发布的少量公告获取一些用语模糊的最新进展。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	14
122	Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	15	部分国会领导人认为总统及其助理不会自愿将权力移交副总统，因此开始起草马歇尔之前所说的联合决议案。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	15
122	However, senators that were opposed to the League of Nations treaty blocked the joint resolution in hopes  to prevent the treaty's ratification.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	16	在这样的情况下，为了防止条约通过，反对组建国际联盟的参议员封杀了联合决议案。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	16
122	These senators believed that as acting president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	17	如果马歇尔成为总统，他有可能会在部分关键位置做出妥协，促使建立国际联盟的条约通过。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	17
122	Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	18	而当时的威尔逊既不愿意也没有可能来做妥协，这样针对条约的辩论也就陷入僵局。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	18
122	On December 4, Lansing announced in a Senate committee hearing that no one in the cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	19	12月4日，蓝辛在一次参议院委员会听证上宣布，包括他在内的所有内阁成员已经超过60天没有看到过威尔逊，更没有同总统交谈过。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	19

122	Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	22	委员会的报告促使国会决定不通过联合决议案。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	22
122	At a Sunday church service in mid-December, in what Marshall believed was an attempt by other officials to force him to assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	23	12月中旬的某个周日，马歇尔正在教堂做礼拜，一名信使带来消息，称威尔逊已经去世。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	23
122	Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	24	震惊之下，马歇尔起身向在场教众宣布这一消息，牧师主持祈祷，众人开始唱颂赞美诗，很多人都哭了。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	24
122	Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	25	和夫人离开教堂后，马歇尔致电白宫询问下一步行程，但却发现总统还在世，这完全是一场骗局。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	25
122	Marshall performed a few ceremonial functions for the remainder of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries.  Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	26	马歇尔在余下的任期内只主持过一些礼仪性事务，如接待外国政要，首位到访美国的欧洲君主、比利时国王阿尔贝一世便是其中之一。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	26
122	Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	27	威尔士亲王爱德华来访时和马歇尔共度了两天，马歇尔充当私人导游，带他游览哥伦比亚特区。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	27
122	First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	28	白宫的大部分日常事务都由第一夫人伊迪丝代劳，她会审查威尔逊的所有通信，对哪些事项可以呈交总统，哪些要委托他人代劳做决定。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	28
122	The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	29	这种群龙无首的局面导致授权组建国际联盟的条约无法通过，反对派批评其中的第10条会令美国同欧洲国家捆绑在一起，导致美国在未获国会授权的情况下被迫卷入战争。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	29
122	Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	30	马歇尔本人支持条约通过，但也建议做出多项调整，如要求所有缔结国认可门罗主义和美国的影响范围，并将第十条改为不具备约束效力的条款。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	30

122	It remains unclear who was making the executive branch's decisions during Wilson's incapacity, but it was likely the first lady with the help of the presidential advisers.	3 ::: 6	Vice presidency ::: Succession crisis	33	威尔逊病倒后白宫究竟是谁在做决策这一问题至今仍无定论，估计很可能是第一夫人在总统助手的帮助下代劳。	3 ::: 6	美国副总统 ::: 继任危机	33

122	He was known to greet citizens walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me."	5	Humor	5	他曾在迎接参观白宫并到达他办公室门前的市民时说：“如果你觉得我像是某种野兽，那就请行行好，朝我扔点花生吧。”	5	幽默	5
122	This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where he would not be disturbed by visitors.	5	Humor	6	这导致威尔逊下令把马歇尔的办公室迁至参议院办公大楼，因为这里通常不会有游客前来。	5	幽默	6

122	Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of presidential powers and duties would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from his duties, even temporarily.	6	Legacy	3	莫里森和另外多位历史学家据此声称，马歇尔当年的决定间接造成第二次世界大战爆发。 查尔斯·托马斯是马歇尔的传记作者之一，他认为马歇尔继任总统的确会大幅降低二戰爆发的可能性，但从现代角度来对这个问题作出推断对于马歇尔来说有欠公平，他决定不强行罢免威尔逊，哪怕只是暂时罢免，这样的决定本身仍然是正确的。	6	影响	3

125	The members of the press, notably Lance Tingay of "The Daily Telegraph", issued rankings for amateur players before the start of the Open Era and for all players after the start of that era.

125	According to the article, Bill Tilden was the best player for seven years and Pancho Gonzales for eight years. While Laver was indisputably the best player from 1965 through 1969, the article asserts that Laver had a valid claim for the top spot also for 1964 and 1970.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	1	根據蘭斯·汀蓋的報導，比爾·提爾登連續七年是最佳球員，而潘喬·岡薩雷斯則連續八年被選為最佳球員，而拉沃則無可爭議地在1965年至1969年之間稱霸，報導中認為拉沃也絕對有資格問鼎1964年和1970年的第一寶座。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	1

125	He writes that although Laver was "absolutely unbeatable for a year or two late in the 1960s", a "careful comparison" could be made between Laver and the somewhat older Gonzales and that Kramer is "positive that Gonzales could have beaten Laver regularly."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	3	他寫道即使拉沃「在1960年代末期的那一兩年絕對無法擊敗」，但是可以更仔細地比較拉沃和年紀較大的岡薩雷斯，而克拉瑪認為岡薩雷斯應該可以持續擊敗拉沃；	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	3
125	Kramer's main argument for downgrading Laver is that, "Ken Rosewall beat Laver in those two World Championship of Tennis finals and that was a title Laver really wanted."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	4	克拉瑪也基於拉沃在亟欲獲得的兩個世界錦標賽冠軍中均敗給羅斯威爾而給拉沃較低的評價；	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	4
125	Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales' superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a US$10,000 winner-take-all, five-set match before 15,000 spectators in New York City's Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the World No. 1 player.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	5	1970年1月在紐約麦迪逊广场花园舉辦的一萬美元獎金贏家全拿的五盤大戰比賽，41歲的岡薩雷斯擊敗當時公認世界第一的拉沃，因此克拉瑪認為這是岡薩雷斯優於拉沃的證據之一。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	5
125	On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match took place and Laver subsequently won this event, beating Gonzales in a straight-sets semifinal.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	6	然而就另一方面而言，岡薩雷斯在這場比賽舉辦時仍然是世界前十名的好手，而且接下來的系列賽都由拉沃獲勝，甚至以直落三在準決賽擊敗岡薩雷斯。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	6
125	Overall, his head-to-head-record with Gonzales was either 35–19 or 38–21 in favour of Laver, depending on the source. Laver was 12–5 against Gonzales during the Open Era, although Gonzales was then in his late thirties.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	7	總體而言，拉沃和岡薩雷斯對戰取得35勝19負的優勢，在公開賽年代拉沃也取得12勝5負的較佳成績，不過此時岡薩雷斯已經30多歲。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	7
125	Many experts disagree with Kramer's assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver as the best of all time.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	8	但許多專家並不同意克拉瑪對拉沃的評價，例如丹·麥斯凱爾、約翰·巴雷特、喬·麥考利、泰德·史洛德、東尼·卓伯特和馬克安諾都將拉沃評為史上最佳球員。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	8
125	Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, "You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver's the best player of all time."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	9	亞倫·全高夫曾引述史洛德的話：「你將所有條件考慮進去：球員時期的長短、在草地和紅土的表現、業餘時期和職業時期的成就和他的所作所為，以所有條件而言，拉沃就是網球史上的最佳球員。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	9
125	Trabert said in January 2008, "I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he's done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	10	卓伯特在2008年1月說道：「我仍然認為拉沃是網球史上最佳球員，因為他達成了許多這個運動120年或140年歷史上從沒有人做到的成就；他在業餘時期贏得網球大滿貫，在職業時期又贏了一次大滿貫。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	10
125	If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you've got to say Laver is the best player of all time."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	11	如果任何其他一種運動中有一位選手保有一項無人能及的世界紀錄，你就會稱他是該項運動的最佳選手，所以我的看法是，你必須承認拉沃是網球史上最佳球員。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	11
125	Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, "Give him credit?  Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [Greatest of All Time] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own.”	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	12	同樣地，網球作家彼得·柏度在2008年5月寫道：「給他評價？真正唯一的問題是GOAT需要辯論嗎？光是兩次贏得年度大滿貫就夠讓拉沃本身成為一個傳奇了。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	12
125	Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era , during the touring pro era , and during the Open Era .	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	13	其他專家則引用數據佐證，在拉沃的業餘時期，職業巡迴賽時期和公開賽年代，他贏了創紀錄的184個單打冠軍，也保有單一年度最多冠軍的紀錄。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	13
125	After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	14	在1963年轉為職業球員後，拉沃在1964年至1967年之間贏了5次美國職業網球錦標賽和4次溫布利職業錦標賽，另外在1969年和1970年賽事改名為英國室內球場錦標賽也贏得冠軍。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	14
125	In 1967, Laver won a "Professional Grand Slam" by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	15	1967年拉沃並贏得了職業錦標巡迴大賽大滿貫，也就是在單一年度中贏得四大職業巡迴賽事冠軍：美國職業網球錦標賽，溫布利職業錦標賽，法國職業網球錦標賽和溫布頓職業巡迴賽。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	15
125	Laver came out on top in various experts polls for the best of all time.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	16	此外，拉沃在許多次的專家票選中均被選為史上最佳球員。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	16

125	Laver ranked first on this list ahead of John McEnroe, Don Budge, Kramer, Bj?rn Borg, Gonzales, Tilden, Jimmy Connors, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad. In a poll by the Associated Press in 2000, Laver was voted "The Male Tennis Player of the Century", ahead of Pete Sampras, Tilden, Borg, Budge, McEnroe and Hoad , Rosewall and Roy Emerson , and Kramer.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	18	拉沃在投票結果中領先馬克安諾、唐·布吉、克拉瑪、博格、岡薩雷茲、提爾登、康諾斯、弗雷德·佩里和盧·侯德等GOAT，獲得第一名；	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	18
125	In an article in "Tennis Week" in 2007, the tennis historian Raymond Lee statistically analysed the all-time best players.

125	Thirteen years later, however, as editor of the "Total Tennis, The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia", Collins was more guarded. He wrote that Laver would "be known as possibly the greatest player ever."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	21	然而13年後，作為巨著《完全網球：終極網球百科全書》的編輯，柯林斯更為篤定，在第693頁中他寫下：「拉沃可能是有史以來最偉大的網球選手。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	21
125	but also said that Gonzales was "probably as good as anyone who ever played the game, if not better."	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	22	在673頁中，柯林斯說道：「岡薩雷茲可能跟任何打過網球的人一樣好，如果沒有更好的話。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	22

125	In an August 2006 article for MSNBC, Collins ranked Laver as one of the five top men's tennis stars of all time, along with Tilden, Gonzales, Borg, and Sampras.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	24	在2006年8月為MSNBC所寫的文章中，柯林斯將拉沃排入五位史上最頂尖男子網球選手之一，其他四位分別為提爾登、岡薩雷茲、博格和山普拉斯。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	24
125	He pointed to Tilden's "phenomenal .938 winning percentage", said "If I had to choose someone to play for my life it would be Pancho Gonzalez", praised Borg's uncanny transition from the French Open to Wimbledon, cited Sampras's "assault on the citadels of the past", and called Laver "in my eyes, the greatest player ever".	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	25	他特別指出提爾登締造了非凡的0.938勝率，也說：「如果要選一個為我打球，那我會選岡薩雷茲。」 他同時稱揚博格在法網和溫布頓之間神秘的過渡轉變，也特別註記山普拉斯衝擊了網球過去的堡壘，但最後總結拉沃是「在我眼中有史以來最偉大的網球選手。」	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	25
125	In 1973, the ATP's computer rankings were established. Laver attained his highest ranking on that computer of World No. 3 in 1974. Laver's highest year-end ranking by the ATP was World No. 4 in 1974. Laver semi-retired from the main professional tennis tour in 1975 while still being ranked in the top 10.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	26	1973年，ATP建立了電腦排名系統，拉沃在這個新的排名系統上的最佳紀錄是1974年中曾站上世界第三，在1974年的年終排名則為世界第四，這也是拉沃在系統上的最佳年終排名，1975年開始，拉沃在主要的職業巡迴賽處於半退休的狀態，但此時仍能名列世界前十名。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	26

125	The number of tournament singles titles that Laver won during his career varies depending on the source. The ATP credits Laver with 46 Open Era titles while "Total Tennis: The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia" , give him 47 or 54 titles during the Open Era alone. Collins credits him with 184 titles in amateur, professional, and open competition, without listing them in detail.	4	Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players	28	拉沃生涯獲得的錦標賽冠軍數目並沒有一致的紀錄，ATP紀錄顯示拉沃獲得40個公開賽冠軍，其他資料例如柯林斯的《完全網球：終極網球百科全書》則紀錄了47個或54個公開賽冠軍，柯林斯認為拉沃在業餘球員時期、職業球員時期和公開賽年代總計獲得了184個冠軍，但沒有詳細列出所有184個冠軍賽事紀錄。	3	史上最偉大網球運動員中的地位	28

134	Chandler's swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical similes are original: "The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel"; "He had a heart as big as one of Mae West's hips"; "Dead men are heavier than broken hearts"; "I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor.”  Chandler's writing redefined the private eye fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective "Chandleresque," and inevitably became the subject of parody and pastiche.	3	Critical reception	1	雖然他急促及冷硬的風格主要是由達許·漢密特所啟發的，但他文中既鋒利又像歌詞般的明擬使用卻是相當具有原創性的。  諸如「那魯格型手鎗的鎗口看起來就像第二街隧道的進出口」以及「那幾分鐘踮着腳地走過，手指放在唇上」等的片語轉換，給私家偵探文學及「錢德勒式」風格下了定義，同時也是無數戲仿和仿作主題和對象。	2	作品风格	1
134	Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some Spanish and sometimes admires Mexicans, and who is a student of chess and classical music.	3	Critical reception	2	然而，他筆下最著名的角色，菲力普·馬羅，卻不是一名老一套的硬漢；更像是一個複雜，偶爾會感情用事，又沒甚麼朋友的人物，他上過一陣子書院，懂一點兒西班牙語，有時會欽佩墨西哥人，正在學象棋及古典音樂。	2	作品风格	2
134	Chandler's short stories and novels are evocatively written, conveying the time, place and ambiance of Los Angeles and environs in the 1930s and 1940s.	3	Critical reception	3	錢德勒的短篇及長篇小說很容易令人想起洛杉磯以及其於30及40年代的氛圍。	2	作品风格	3
134	The places are real, if pseudonymous: Bay City is Santa Monica, Gray Lake is Silver Lake, and Idle Valley a synthesis of wealthy San Fernando Valley communities.	3	Critical reception	4	他描述過的很多地點用了真名，但有些則用了假名：海灣市一般被認為是代表聖蒙尼卡，而空閒谷則是聖弗蘭多谷中多個不同的富人飛地的混合體。	2	作品风格	4
134	Arguably the most notable adaptation is "The Big Sleep" , by Howard Hawks, with Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.	3	Critical reception	5	錢德勒的所有小說都曾被改編成電影，最著名的是電影《夜長夢多》，由霍華德·霍克斯導演，亨弗萊·鮑嘉及洛琳·白考兒主演。	2	作品风格	5
134	William Faulkner was a co-writer of the screenplay.	3	Critical reception	6	小說家威廉·福克納也有參與這部影片的劇本寫作。	2	作品风格	6
134	Chandler's few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American "film noir" genre.	3	Critical reception	7	錢德勒的劇本，跟以前一樣有限，及1940年代從他的小說改編搬到大銀幕的電影對美國的黑色電影有着重要的影響。	2	作品风格	7

148	Of his early portraits done at York or Cobourg before his travels, Harper writes, "[they] are primitive in approach but have a direct appeal and a warm colouring that make them attractive".	4	Works	1	约翰·哈珀如此评价在凯恩旅行之前在约克和科堡的肖像作品，“它们很手法很简单，但是很有感染力，暖色调的运用使他们变得吸引人注意。”	4	作品	1

148	Together, these formed the basis for his later studio work.	4	Works	6	这些都是他以后工作室作品的基础。	4	作品	6
148	He drew on this pool of impressions for his large oil canvases, in which he typically combined or reinterpreted them to create new compositions.	4	Works	7	他将这些素材组合运用，融入到大型油画作品中。	4	作品	7
148	The field sketches are a valuable resource for ethnologists, but the oil paintings, while still truthful in the individual details of Native American lifestyle, are often unfaithful to geographic, historic, or ethnographic settings in their overall compositions.	4	Works	8	他的写生是研究民族学的非常有价值的资料，而油画作品，虽然也生动地刻画了美国土著民族生活，但是由于是再创作，而不能作为地理、历史和民族学研究的直接参考证据。	4	作品	8
148	One well-known example of this process is Kane's painting "Flathead woman and child", in which he combined a sketch of a Chinookan baby having its head flattened by being strapped to a cradle board with a later field portrait of a Cowlitz woman living in a different region.	4	Works	9	《平头族妇女和孩子》是凯恩的这种再创作手法的一个例子，他的一张写生里描绘了一个奇努克族孩子，该孩子头部被木板压着，来达到强制头骨变平的目的，这也是当地民族的一种风俗。凯恩将这幅写生和在其它地区画的另一张写生考利兹妇女结合在一起，创作出《平头族妇女和孩子》。	4	作品	9

148	The painting has a distinct romantic flair accentuated by the lighting and the dramatic clouds, while the scene of the camp life depicted is reminiscent of a European idealized rural peasant scene.	4	Works	11	在油画中，他加入独特的浪漫主义技巧，强调了光线和梦幻般的云彩，画中描绘的野营生活就像欧洲理想化的田园生活的怀旧版。	4	作品	11
148	Indeed, Kane often created completely fictitious scenes from several sketches for his oil paintings.	4	Works	12	实际上，凯恩经常从他的几幅写生作品中为他的油画虚构出一些场景。	4	作品	12
148	His oil canvas of "Mount St. Helens erupting" shows a major and dramatic volcanic eruption, but from his travel diary and the field sketches he made, it is evident that the mountain had only been smoking gently at the time of Kane's visit.	4	Works	13	他的油画作品《圣海伦火山爆发》展现了一个壮观的火山喷发的画面，但是从他的旅行日记和写生作品来看，在他旅行期间，圣海伦火山只是轻微地冒烟而已。	4	作品	13
148	In other paintings he combined river sketches taken at different times and places into one painting, creating an artificial landscape that does not exist in reality.	4	Works	14	在其它作品里，他将不同时间和地点画的河流的写生结合到一幅油画中，描绘出实际上并不存在的风景。	4	作品	14
148	His models were the classic European paintings, but Kane also had plain economic reasons for composing his oil paintings in the more mannered style of the European art tradition.	4	Works	15	凯恩作画的主要手法是经典的欧洲风格，由于经济的原因，他的作品也融入了欧洲美术常见的做作的手法。	4	作品	15
148	He wanted and had to sell his paintings to make a living, and he knew his clientele well enough: his patrons were unlikely to decorate their homes with unadorned copies in oil of his field sketches; they demanded something more presentable and closer to the generally Eurocentric expectations of the time.	4	Works	16	他需要出售这些画作来维持生活，他的主顾不希望用直接复制素描的油画来装饰他们的家，而是希望那些画更漂亮，更贴近当时流行欧洲大部分作品的风格。	4	作品	16
148	Kane's embellishment is evident in his painting "Assiniboine hunting buffalo", one of the twelve done for the parliament.	4	Works	17	在凯恩的作品为国会画的12幅作品中的《阿西尼玻人捕猎野牛》里，这种修饰的意图非常明显。	4	作品	17
148	The painting has been criticized for its horses, which look more like Arabians than any Indian breed.	4	Works	18	画中的马更像阿拉伯马而不是印第安马，这幅画也因此受到了批评。	4	作品	18
148	The composition has even been found to be a based on an 1816 engraving from Italy showing two Romans hunting a bull.	4	Works	19	这幅画的构图是基于1816年意大利的一副雕刻，展现出两个罗马人在捕猎公牛的场景。	4	作品	19
148	Already in 1877, Nicholas Flood Davin commented on this discrepancy, stating that "the Indian horses are Greek horses, the hills have much of the colour and form of those of [...] the early European landscape painters, ..."	4	Works	20	1877年，尼古拉斯·弗勒德·达文指出了两者的差别，“画中印第安马其实是希腊马，小山的色调运用象早期欧洲的风景画。”	4	作品	20
148	And Lawrence J. Burpee added in his introduction to the 1925 reprint of Kane's travel book that the sketches were "truer interpretations of the wild western life" and had "in some respects a higher value as art".	4	Works	21	劳伦斯·J·伯比在1925年凯恩的游记再版时指出，“写生反映的是真实的原始的西部生活，从某种方面来说是艺术的无价之宝。”	4	作品	21

148	Another auction at Sotheby's on November 22, 2004, for Kane's oil painting "Encampment, Winnipeg River"  failed when bidding stopped at C$1.7 million, less than the expected sale price of C$2–2.5 million.	4	Works	29	2004年11月22日，索斯比拍卖行拍卖了凯恩的另一幅油画《温尼伯河畔的营地》只拍出了170万加元，没有达到预计的250万加元而流拍。	4	作品	29

148	In 1986 Dawkins criticized Kane's work based mainly on this travel account, but also on the "European" nature of his oil paintings, as showing the imperialistic or even racist tendencies of the artist.	4	Works	31	1986年，道金斯认为凯恩的作品主要基于他的旅行见闻，但是在他的油画中体现出帝国主义甚至种族偏见。	4	作品	31
148	This view remains rather singular among art historians.	4	Works	32	在艺术历史学家中，这种观点尚有争议。	4	作品	32
148	Kane's travel diary, which formed the basis for the 1859 book, does not contain any pejorative judgements.	4	Works	33	凯恩原始的旅行笔记中，并没有包括任何轻蔑的判断。	4	作品	33
148	MacLaren reported that Kane's travel notes were written in a style very different from the published text, such that it must be considered highly likely that the book was heavily edited by others or even ghostwritten to turn Kane's notes into a Victorian travel account, and that it was thus difficult at best to ascribe any perceived racism to the artist himself.	4	Works	34	麦克拉伦认为凯恩笔记的风格和出版文字风格有很大的区别，因此该书在出版时很可能被别人大幅度修改甚至重写成维多利亚女王时代流行的旅行笔记风格，因而很难得出艺术家本人有种族偏见的结论。	4	作品	34

152	On ego identity versus role confusion—ego identity enables each person to have a sense of individuality, or as Erikson would say, "Ego identity, then, in its subjective aspect, is the awareness of the fact that there is a self-sameness and continuity to the ego's synthesizing methods and a continuity of one's meaning for others".	5	Erikson's theory of personality	40	當自我認同對上角色混亂，自我認同能夠讓每一個人都擁有個性，或者如艾瑞克森所述：「那麼，主觀來說，自我認同是一種自我同化與自我統合方法連續性的真實察覺，以及對他人意義的連續性。」	4	埃里克森的人格理论	40
152	Role confusion, however, is, according to Barbara Engler, "the inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member of one's own society."	5	Erikson's theory of personality	41	然而，依據芭芭拉·恩格勒的著作《Personality Theories》，角色混亂是「設想自己為一個自我社群的生產力成員之無力感。」	4	埃里克森的人格理论	41
152	This inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member is a great danger; it can occur during adolescence, when looking for an occupation.	5	Erikson's theory of personality	42	這種無力感是一個很大的危機；這會發生在青少年在尋找職業的時候。	4	埃里克森的人格理论	42

153	Maria and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.	3	Death	10	1918年7月17日凌晨，尤羅夫斯基進入房間，命令他們站著，並且宣讀執行死刑的判決。 在尤羅夫斯基下令開槍殺死他們之前，瑪麗亞與她的家人只有時間去發出幾個不連貫驚嚇或抗議的聲音。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	62
153	The first volley of gunfire killed the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded the family's doctor and the empress' maidservant.	3	Death	11	第一波炮火殺死沙皇尼古拉二世、皇后及兩位男傭人，並導致家庭醫生與皇后婢女受傷。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	63

153	A heavy layer of smoke had accumulated in the room from the gunfire and from plaster dust released from the walls by errant bullets, and the gunmen could see only the lower bodies of those who were still alive.	3	Death	14	由於在短時間內有許多武器開火，且因子彈擊中牆壁上的石膏，所以房間內佈滿濃煙，所以槍手只能藉著地上的屍體辨認有誰仍然活著。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	66
153	Ermakov fired at Maria, and his bullet struck her in the thigh.	3	Death	15	埃爾馬科夫向瑪麗亞開火，子彈擊中了她的大腿。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	67

153	The assassins then left the room for several minutes to let the haze clear, and when they returned they killed Dr Botkin, Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana.	3	Death	17	槍手隨後離開房間幾分鐘讓濃煙散去，然後回來殺死波特金醫生，阿列克谢·尼古拉耶维奇、奧麗加與塔季揚娜大公。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	69

153	He struggled with Maria and tried to stab her with a bayonet. The jewels sewn into her clothes protected her, and he said he finally shot her in the head. But the skull that is almost certainly Maria's has no bullet wound.	3	Death	19	他與瑪麗亞扭打並試圖用刺刀殺死她，但是縫製在衣服裡的珠寶保護著她，於是他說他最後向她的頭部開槍，但幾乎可以肯定瑪麗亞的頭骨並沒有子彈造成的傷口。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	71
153	Perhaps the drunken Ermakov inflicted a scalp wound, knocking her unconscious and producing a considerable flow of blood, leading Ermakov to think he had killed her.	3	Death	20	也許喝醉酒的埃爾馬科夫只造成頭皮受傷，導致她失去意識並造成相當大量的出血，因此埃爾馬科夫認為他已殺死她。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	72
153	He then struggled with Anastasia, whom he also claimed he shot in the head.	3	Death	21	然後他與阿納斯塔西婭扭打，他也聲稱對她的頭部開槍。	2	第一次世界大戰、革命與監禁	73

153	Most historians continued  to discount the claims that Maria or any other member of the family survived the killings.	4	Claims of survival	15	大多數歷史學家聲稱瑪麗亞或其他的皇室成員曾在這次謀殺中倖存下來。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	15
153	In 1991, bodies believed to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	0	幾具屍體在1991年從葉卡特林堡郊外的樹林中的大墳墓被挖掘出來，歷史學家認為這些屍體是尼古拉二世全家與他們的僕人。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	16
153	The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	1	這個墓地在將近十年前就被發現了，不過這個消息被刻意隱瞞著，以免被當時統治蘇聯的共產黨政府得知。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	17
153	Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	2	根據後來法庭專家威廉·莫普勒斯博士的調查，阿纳斯塔西娅的屍體並未出現在這個墓地中。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	18
153	Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	3	然而俄羅斯科學家對此提出質疑，認為應該是瑪麗亞女大公的屍體不見了。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	19
153	The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	4	這些俄羅斯科學家使用電腦程式來比對阿纳斯塔西娅的照片與墳墓中這些屍體的頭骨來鑑定阿纳斯塔西娅。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	20
153	A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	5	俄羅斯的法庭專家認為，沒有任何一個頭骨的門牙之間的縫隙與瑪麗亞一樣。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	21
153	American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	6	美國科學家認為遺失的屍體應該是阿纳斯塔西娅，因為沒有任何一具女性骨骼顯示出未成年的跡象，例如不成熟的鎖骨、隱藏的智齒與不成熟背部脊椎骨，這些特徵是這些科學家預期會在17歲的女孩身上發現。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	22
153	In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7 inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	7	當這些皇室的遺體在1998年被埋葬後，一具大約5呎7吋高的屍體以阿纳斯塔西娅的名義埋葬在墓地中，但是瑪麗亞在遇害前6個月與姐姐們一起拍攝的照片顯示她比阿纳斯塔西娅高了幾吋，也比姊姊奧麗加還高。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	23
153	However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	8	然而骨骼的高度只能估計，因為有一些骨頭被砍掉了，且部分的骨骼也遺失 。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	24
153	Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	9	由於牙齒和大部份的下顎在幾個頭骨上都不見蹤影，所以俄羅斯科學家認為墳墓中的遺體是阿纳斯塔西娅，而不是瑪麗亞，沒有任何一個頭骨的門牙之間的縫隙與瑪麗亞一樣，美國科學家也發現同樣的問題。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	25
153	The mitochondrial DNA from the skeletons was compared against mitochondrial DNA from relatives of the imperial family in the maternal line of descent, including the Tsarina's great-nephew Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and was found to be a match.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	10	科學家在這些骨骼中萃取出粒線體DNA，並與尼古拉二世親戚的粒線體DNA來加以比較，包括亞歷山德拉·費奧多蘿芙娜的親戚菲利普亲王。 科學家發現這些骨骼的粒線體DNA與皇室親戚互相吻合。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	26
153	Scientists believed that the matching DNA was enough to identify the remains of the Imperial Family and their servants.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	11	科學家相信粒線體DNA足以證明這些骨骼就是屬於尼古拉二世全家與他們僕人。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	27
153	The "Yurovsky Note", a report filed by commander Yakov Yurovsky with his superiors following the murders, stated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	12	雅科夫·尤羅夫斯基與監督這次屠殺的上級長官編寫了報告「尤羅夫斯基筆記」，記錄到他們把兩具遺體搬移到一處秘密的地區來焚燒。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	28
153	If the Whites ever discovered the grave, Yurovsky believed they would doubt the grave belonged to the Tsar and his retinue because the body count would be incorrect.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	13	如果白軍發現這處墓地，將會因為遺體數目有誤而懷疑這些遺體是否屬於尼古拉二世全家。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	29
153	Some forensic experts believe the complete burning of two bodies in so short a time would have been impossible given the environment and materials possessed by Yurovsky and his men.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	14	一些法庭專家相信尤羅夫斯基的人馬無法這如此短暫的時間中將這兩具遺體焚燒的如此徹底。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	30
153	Initial searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	15	在接下來的數十年當中，許多人在這個地區進行的研究仍然無法發現一個火葬地或是這兩具失蹤的皇室成員遺體。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	31
153	However, on 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	16	然而在2007年8月23日，一位俄羅斯考古學家宣佈在葉卡捷琳堡附近的一處營火地發現兩具被焚燒不完全的屍骨，而且這個地點符合尤羅夫斯基回憶錄中所描述的。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	32
153	The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	17	這位考古學家說這些屍骨是一位年紀大約在10到13歲的男孩與一位年紀界於18與23歲之間的年輕女子。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	33
153	Maria was nineteen years, one month old at the time of the assassinations while her sister Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was less than a month shy of his fourteenth birthday.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	18	瑪麗亞在遇難時的年紀是19歲又過1個月，而妹妹阿纳斯塔西娅的年紀則是18歲1個月，阿列克謝則還差兩個星期才滿14歲。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	34
153	Maria's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassinations.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	19	瑪麗亞的大姊奧麗加與二姊塔季揚娜當時分別是22歲與21歲。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	35
153	Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found "shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber."	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	20	這位考古學家在這兩具屍體附近發現了一個裝著硫酸的容器碎片、釘子、屬於一個木製盒子的金屬條與不同口徑的子彈。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	36
153	The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	21	「這些屍骨是由金屬探測與金屬棒來發現的。」	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	37
153	On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing proves that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to a young woman the Russians continue to identify as Maria.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	22	經過DNA測試後，他們在2008年4月30日宣佈確認這些遺骸為阿列克謝皇儲與一位年輕女子，俄羅斯科學家確認這位年輕女子為瑪麗亞。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	38
153	Eduard Rossel, governor of the region 900 miles east of Moscow, said tests done by a U.S. laboratory had identified the shards as those of Alexei and Maria.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	23	愛德華·羅塞爾是莫斯科以東900英里地區的政府官員，他說美國實驗室所做的測試已確定那些碎片屬於阿列克謝與瑪麗亞所有。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	39
153	In March 2009, results of the DNA testing were published, confirming that the two bodies discovered in 2007 were those of Tsarevich Alexei and one of the four Grand Duchesses.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	24	2009年3月公佈的DNA檢測結果確認這兩個在2007年被發現的屍體屬於維奇羅曼阿列克謝與一位女大公。	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	40
153	"This has confirmed that indeed it is the children," he said.	5	Romanov graves and DNA proof	25	羅塞爾說：「這證實了屍體屬於這些孩子們，我們現在已經找到了全部的皇室成員。」	3	倖存的傳聞與發現墳墓	41

157	The name  means roughly "mouth of the well of the Itza", the "well" being the nearby Sacred Cenote  and "Itza" being the name of the people who were reputed to be its former inhabitants.	5 ::: 1	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Context	4	“奇琴伊察”的意思大约是“伊察井口”，“井”位于靠近圣泉的地方，而“伊察”是以前这里居民的名称。	5 ::: 1	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 背景	4
157	Over the next three centuries after the Conquest, the site remained relatively undisturbed until the arrival of Stephens and Catherwood, although several plantations were established nearby.	5 ::: 1	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Context	5	在被占领3个世纪后，除了附近建立了几个种植园外，遗址在斯蒂芬斯和卡瑟伍德到来前依旧保存相对完好。	5 ::: 1	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 背景	5
157	At the time its full extent was not at all clear, but today it is recognised as one of the largest Maya sites in the Yucatán region.	5 ::: 1	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Context	6	当时整个遗址的具体范围还不清楚，如今已经被认为是尤卡坦地区最大的玛雅遗址。	5 ::: 1	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 背景	6
157	How long ago the site had been functionally abandoned  was not immediately apparent, although it appeared to have been recently, in comparison with the seemingly older abandoned sites of the central and southern Maya region.	5 ::: 1	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Context	7	没有显著的证据表明具体遗址荒芜了多久，尽管与其他中南美洲的玛雅地区内更早被废弃的遗址比起来似乎时间不长。	5 ::: 1	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 背景	7
157	In 1924, armed with a renewable ten-year digging concession from the Mexican government, Morley, his field director Earl H. Morris, artists Ann Axtel Morris and Jean Charlot, and several others began their first explorations.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	0	1924年，带着与墨西哥政府签订的可续签的10年挖掘合同，莫利和他的向导厄尔·H·莫里斯、艺术家安·阿克斯特尔·莫里斯和琼·夏洛特、以及其他人一起开始了他们的第一次勘测。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	0
157	They selected an area within what appeared to be the central plaza of the site, where the capitals of some columns lay exposed.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	1	他们选择了看起来是遗址的中央广场的一个区域，那里有一些外露的柱頂。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	1
157	This complex , un-Maya-like in both execution and arrangement, added confirmation to earlier speculations that Chichen Itza was something of an enigma.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	2	这种建筑群在建造和排列上不是玛雅风格，使較早前認為伊琴奇察是個難解之謎的猜想更加確定。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	2
157	This arrangement had much more in common with the architectural styles of civilizations in central Mexico  than that of the Classic or Pre-Classic Maya.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	3	这种排列方式更象是一千公里之外中墨西哥文明的建筑风格。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	3
157	In particular, this complex and some others which were gradually revealed appeared to have much in common with structures built at Tula, believed to be the capital of the Toltecs and which was located about 100 km north of present-day Mexico City.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	4	特别是，这个建筑和其它逐渐被发掘的建筑与图拉的建筑风格很接近，图拉被认为是前哥伦布时期托尔特克的首府，位于今天墨西哥城以北100公里处。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	4
157	Over the next few seasons, the team expanded their digs, recovering other anomalous structures from the earthen mounds, such as the Temple of the Jaguar and the Temple of the Warriors.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	5	在接下来的几个挖掘季节，他们扩展了挖掘范围，在东面的小山发现了一些其它的特别的建筑，如美洲虎神殿和勇士神殿。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	5
157	In 1927 they discovered an older structure underneath this latter, which they called the "Temple of the Chacmool" after a further example found of this distinctive statuary.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	6	1927年，他们在勇士神殿下面发现了一个更古老的建筑，因發現另一個獨特的查克穆尔雕像，他們将這建築命名为查克穆尔神殿。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	6
157	These structures had frescoes which again exhibited a non-Maya style, or at least a hybrid of Maya and non-Maya.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	7	这些建筑中有很多濕壁畫，同樣展现出非玛雅风格，或者说是玛雅和非玛雅的混合体。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	7
157	They also worked on the reconstruction of "el Caracol", a unique circular building believed  to be an observatory.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	8	他们还修复了一个后来被确认为天文台的圆形特别建筑──埃尔卡拉科尔。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	8
157	While Morris oversaw day-to-day operations, and Charlot sketched the murals, Morley occupied himself with copying all the inscriptions he could find, particularly the date portions.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	9	莫里斯负责监督日常的工作，夏洛特为壁画做速写，莫利自己则复制了所有他能找到的碑铭，尤其是日期部分。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	9
157	Since most of these inscription dates at the site were recorded in an abbreviated form known as the "Short Count", which only identified an event within a span of about 260 years, it was difficult to pin down in which particular span an event referred to in the inscriptions occurred.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	10	因为所有的碑铭上的日期都是用缩写的方式记录的，即“短期积日制历法”，只能表示一个事件发生在260年的范围内，所以很难区分出碑铭提及的事件具体发生在哪个特定的范围。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	10
157	Towards the end of the project Morley's work on these was to be superseded somewhat by a more-comprehensive analysis made by Hermann Beyer in 1937.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	11	到了项目的末期，莫利在这方面的有些工作被赫尔曼·拜尔更综合的分析方法取代。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	11
157	In this work, Beyer would note:  I frequently have differed with the opinions of Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	12	拜尔记录道：  我经常与西尔韦纳斯·G·莫利博士有不同的意见。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	12
157	This is easily explained by the fact that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	13	毫无疑问，這是因為他是少数研究过奇琴伊察象形文字的考古学家之一。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	13
157	While I agree with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	14	我認同他关于有很多日期和时间的古帝国城市碑铭的研究结果，但是我認為他只分析曆法的方法無法應用於奇琴伊察，因为有關曆法的象形文字太少了。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	14
157	The later years of the project would increasingly concentrate on completing the restorative work on the principal structures, for Morley always had an eye on the dual purpose of the project: to research, but also rebuild to generate the promised revenue from tourism.	5 ::: 3	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Major finds	15	项目的后期逐渐把重心移到完成主要建筑的修复工作上，因为莫利运作这个项目有两个目的：其一是研究，另一个是修复，从而通过旅游业产生预期的经济效益。	5 ::: 2	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 主要发现	15
157	The net research result of their excavations revealed Chichen Itza to be an unusual mixture of building styles: not only was there a wide variety of Maya styles such as Puuc, Rio Bec and Chenes, but a significant presence of Mexican influences such as El Tajín, but more particularly Toltec.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	0	他们的研究结果发现奇琴伊察是一个不同寻常的建筑风格的混合体：不仅是有各种各样的玛雅风格，如普克、里奥贝克和切尼斯风格，还有受墨西哥风格影响重大的建筑，如埃尔塔欣，更多的是托尔特克风格。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	0
157	The evidence indicated that the site had been inhabited since at least the mid-Classic, but that a particular florescence had occurred in the Post-Classic, when the site was apparently a major power.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	1	这些证据表明遗址在中世纪就有人居住，并于在后古典期达到一个空前繁荣的阶段，遗址显然曾经是一个主要国家。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	1
157	From the combined results of their work, that of others, and some documented tales of contact-era Maya peoples, a view was formed that Chichen Itza had actually been invaded and conquered sometime in the 10th century by Toltec warriors from the far west, who maintained their hold over the local Maya for another century or so, only in turn to be replaced by a later mixed Maya-Mexica group known as the Itza.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	2	从他们发现的综合风格的建筑和一些关于玛雅人的传说的记载中，形成了这样一种理论，即奇琴伊察曾于公元10世纪某个时期被遥远的西部的托尔特克人入侵和征服，并控制了本地玛雅人大约一个世纪左右。 反过来，他们被一个后来形成的混合的玛雅墨西哥民族-伊察所取代。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	2
157	Later evidence suggested that the actual year of this invasion was 987, and identified its leader with a legendary Toltec ruler called Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl after the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl .	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	3	后来的证据表明确切的入侵时间是987年，其首领为一个传奇的托尔特克统治者-他被称作Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl，名字来自中亚美利加洲神灵羽蛇神。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	3
157	Morley was in general opposed to ideas that other external groups had influenced the Maya, but in this case, since the conquest occurred in the "degenerate" Post-Classic phase he found it acceptable.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	4	通常，莫利对于其它外来民族影响玛雅的观点持反对态度。 但是在这个案例中，由于入侵发生在后古典的衰败时期，他觉得可以接受这种观点。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	4
157	This view of the Toltec invasion of Yucatán became the one maintained by the majority of Mayanists.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	5	尤卡坦托尔特克的入侵的观点成为大部分玛雅学家坚持的观点。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	5
157	However, recent research from the mid-1990s onwards has now questioned this orthodoxy, to the point where many now hold an actual invasion did not take place, but the similarities in style are largely due to cultural diffusion and trade, and that in fact there is evidence that the diffusion in this period flowed in both directions.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	6	然而，从1990年代中期开始的最新研究对这种观点提出了疑问，很多人现在认为实际上并没有入侵过程，相似的建筑风格主要是由于文化传播和贸易，事实上，已经有证据表明这个时期的文化传播在两个方向上都存在。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	6
157	The chronology of Chichen Itza continues to be a source of debate, and the hoped-for answers to the mystery of the Classic Maya decline elusive .	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	7	奇琴伊察的年代依旧是辩论的主题，古典玛雅的衰落也是一个谜。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	7
157	However, the Carnegie excavations did add significantly to the corpus of available information, and are notable for their scope alone, if not for fine details and quality of research.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	8	然而，卡内基的挖掘极大地增加了有效的信息资料，并且以范围独立而著称。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	8
157	The site's reconstruction by Carnegie has proved to be a lasting one, and the site today is among the most visited of pre-Columbian ruins in all of Central America and Mexico, with in excess of a million visitors per year.	5 ::: 4	Excavations at Chichen Itza ::: Result summary	9	卡内基运作的遗址重建工作是一个长期的过程，今天遗址已经成为中美洲和墨西哥参观人数最多的前哥伦比亚废墟之一，每年游客超过百万名。	5 ::: 3	发掘奇琴伊察 ::: 发现总结	9
157	After almost twenty years, Carnegie's Chichen Itza project wound to a close in 1940, its restorative and investigative work complete and its objectives substantially met.	6	Project completion and final years	0	大约二十年以后，卡内基奇琴伊察项目于1940年结束，挖掘和研究工作完成，大体上实现原定的目标。	6	项目完成和最后的岁月	0
157	He was appointed director of the School of American Research and the Museum of New Mexico, following the death of Edgar Lee Hewett in 1946.	6	Project completion and final years	1	莫利回到了美国，担任美国研究学校和新墨西哥博物馆的管理职位。	6	项目完成和最后的岁月	1
157	He also began work on a large-scale popular work on ancient Maya society, which he completed and published in 1946.	6	Project completion and final years	2	同时他开始了关于古玛雅社会的大规模的著作的撰写，1946年该项工作结束并出版。	6	项目完成和最后的岁月	2
157	Morley last visited Yucatán and the Hacienda Chenku in spring of 1948, just months before his death.	6	Project completion and final years	3	1948年，西尔韦纳斯·莫利在他最后的著作出版的两年后逝世，享壽65岁。	6	项目完成和最后的岁月	3
157	In his day, Morley was widely regarded as one of the leading figures in Maya scholarship, in authority perhaps second only to Eric Thompson, whose views he mostly shared.	7	Theories and retrospective assessment	0	在西尔韦纳斯·莫利所处的时代，他被广泛认为是玛雅研究学者的主要人物，在学术上可能仅次于埃里克·汤姆森，汤姆森很多观点是与莫利一起提出的。	7	理论和评价	0
157	From the late 1920s through to perhaps the mid-1970s, the reconstruction of ancient Maya society and history pieced together by Morley, Thompson and others constituted the "standard" interpretation against which competing views had to be measured.	7	Theories and retrospective assessment	1	从1920年代后期一直到1970年代中期，莫利、汤姆森和其它人将古玛雅社会和历史的片段串连起来，他们坚持自己的方法是“标准”的解释，其它的方法则需要被评估。	7	理论和评价	1
157	However, major advances made in the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing and refinements in archaeological data which have been made since that time have now called into question much of this former "standard" interpretation, overturning key elements and significantly revising the Maya historical account.	7	Theories and retrospective assessment	2	然而，当时的关于考古资料中玛雅象形文字的“标准”解释如今遭到了质疑，推翻了关键元素，极大地修正了玛雅历史数据。	7	理论和评价	2
157	As far as Morley's own research is concerned, its reputation for soundness and quality has been downgraded somewhat in the light of recent reappraisals; yet he is still regarded as an important contributor to the field.	7	Theories and retrospective assessment	3	就莫利自己的研究而言，根据最新的评价，他声誉和才能也有所下降， 然而他依旧被认为是该领域的一位重要贡献者。	7	理论和评价	3
157	Many Mayan scholars and archaeologists had their first research opportunity and employment under Morley's tutelage working on the various Carnegie projects.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	0	许多玛雅学者和考古学家是在莫利指导的众多卡内基项目下开始他们的首次研究。	8	对其他学者的影响	0
157	Of these, perhaps the two most notable were J. Eric S. Thompson and Tatiana Proskouriakoff.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	1	约翰·埃里克·西德尼·汤姆森和塔蒂阿娜·普罗斯库里亚科夫或许是他们中间最著名的学者。	8	对其他学者的影响	1
157	Thompson shortly became the field's most dominant figure and its uncontested expert.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	2	汤姆森很快成为该领域的核心人物和专家。	8	对其他学者的影响	2
157	Together with Morley, he was most responsible for promulgating the view of the ancient Maya as peaceable astronomers, obsessed with time and calendric observations.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	3	他和莫利一起提出见解，认为古玛雅人是和平的天文学家，着迷于时间和时间的观察。	8	对其他学者的影响	3
157	This view became the prevailing one for the next several decades.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	4	这种观点在接下来的几十年里很盛行。	8	对其他学者的影响	4
157	Proskouriakoff also went on to establish a stellar career and a lifelong association with the Carnegie Institution; however, her researches ultimately provided the primary convincing evidence which later disproved much of what had been maintained by Thompson and Morley.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	5	普罗斯库里亚科夫的职业生涯也很成功，并且终身与卡内基研究所保持良好的合作。 然而，后来她的研究提供了有力的证据证明汤姆森和莫利所坚持的大部分观点是错误的。	8	对其他学者的影响	5
157	In 1925, a young English Cambridge anthropology student named John Eric Sidney Thompson wrote to Morley seeking employment with the Carnegie programme on digs in Central America.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	6	1925年，一位名叫约翰·埃里克·西德尼·汤姆森的年轻的英国剑桥大学考古专业学生写信给莫利，希望能在卡内基在中美洲的发掘项目里谋求一个职位。	8	对其他学者的影响	6
157	Thompson had studied Morley's 1915 work and from that taught himself Maya calendrics, which were a particular passion for Morley.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	7	汤姆森研究了莫利1915年出版的著作，通过该书他自学了玛雅历。	8	对其他学者的影响	7
157	The Carnegie Institution at Morley's urging accordingly hired Thompson, and he soon found himself at work in Chichen Itza, involved with its architectural reconstruction .	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	8	莫利说服卡内基研究所雇佣了汤姆森，不久他就来到奇琴伊察，从事建筑修复工作。	8	对其他学者的影响	8
157	During the 1925–26 season, Thompson became well-acquainted with Morley, the two of them along with their wives  making several side-trips together.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	9	1925到26年的工作季节期间，汤姆森与莫利的关系非常亲密，两人与他们的妻子一起郊游了好几次。 事实上，对于新婚的汤姆森，当时正处于蜜月。	8	对其他学者的影响	9
157	However, at the end of the 1926 season, Thompson left Carnegie's employ to take up a post offered by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	10	1926年工作季节结束后，汤姆森离开了卡内基，开始为芝加哥菲爾德自然史博物館工作。	8	对其他学者的影响	10
157	This post offered Thompson far greater freedom and diversity for his research.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	11	这个职位为汤姆森的研究提供了更大的自由度和多样性。	8	对其他学者的影响	11
157	Thompson and Morley were to remain close and like-minded colleagues in spite of this move.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	12	虽然两人分开，但是汤姆森和莫利继续保持了良好的关系，一直是志趣相投的伙伴。	8	对其他学者的影响	12
157	The quality of her reconstructive panorama drawings  so impressed Morley that he determined to enroll her onto the Carnegie staff.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	13	她描绘的重建全景的图片质量让莫利印象深刻，因此决定邀请她成为卡内基的雇员。	8	对其他学者的影响	13
157	However, this was in the midst of the Great Depression and funds for hiring were scarce; it was also not clear whether Morley had the appropriate authority to do so.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	14	然而，由于当时正处于大萧条的中期，雇佣的资金很紧缺，并且莫利是否具有该权力也尚未明确。	8	对其他学者的影响	14
157	After several entreaties, Morley again came up with an innovative funding scheme whereby he devised two campaigns to raise money by subscription to send Proskouriakoff to Copán and the Yucatán.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	15	在几次尝试后，莫利再次提出新的资金方案，他组织了两项活动，通过捐助凑集资金使普罗斯库里亚科夫前往科潘和尤卡坦州。	8	对其他学者的影响	15
157	These were successful, and in 1939, Proskouriakoff transferred onto the Carnegie payroll and was duly dispatched to Copán to gather data for reconstructive drawings of that site.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	16	此举获得了成功，1939年，普罗斯库里亚科夫成为卡内基的一员，并被派遣到科潘为当地遗址的重建图收集数据。	8	对其他学者的影响	16
157	Morley's support of Proskouriakoff was to prove fortuitous to Maya scholarship, as she went on to a lengthy and successful career with the Carnegie Institution and was lauded as one of the foremost Maya scholars of her time.	7 ::: 1	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Influences on other scholars	17	莫利帮助普罗斯库里亚科夫的举动是玛雅文化的一个意外收获，之后她在卡内基研究所度过了她的职业生涯，并得到了成功，被誉为她所处时代最重要的玛雅学者之一。	8	对其他学者的影响	17
157	Morley maintained that ancient Maya society was essentially a united theocracy, and one which was almost exclusively devoted to astronomical observations and mystically noting  the passage of time.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	0	莫利认为古玛雅社会本质上是一个联合的神权政治，专注于天文观测和计算时间流逝的神秘方法。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	0
157	These ideas  are now extensively modified, and although astronomical and calendric observations were clearly important to the Maya, the people themselves are now seen in more historical, realistic terms—concerned also with dynastic succession, political conquests, and the lives and achievements of actual personages.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	1	这些汤姆森后来致力于发展完善的理论现在大部分已经被修正了，尽管天文和曆法观测显然对于玛雅人很重要，现在用更历史性的角度来看，当时王朝的继承、政治征服以及实际的知名人物的生活和成就也同样值得关注。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	1
157	He also believed that the southern centers such as Copán and Quiriguá had been united in the Classical period under what he termed the "Old Empire".	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	2	他也相信南部的一些中心地区在古典时期曾联合在一起，并命名为“古帝国”。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	2
157	This empire mysteriously collapsed, but the remnants later migrated to the northern sites  to form a "New Empire".	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	3	这个帝国神秘地瓦解了，但是残余的部分后来移居到北部的位置形成一个“新帝国”。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	3
157	It is now generally accepted that at no time was the Maya region united under a single polity, but rather that individual "city-states" maintained a somewhat independent existence, albeit one with its fluctuating conquests and local subservience to more dominant centers.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	4	如今普遍被接受的观点是玛雅区域从来没有联合在一个单一政体的统治下，而是保持了一种的独特的“城市状态”，互相独立存在，即使有不断的互相占领以及弱小民族归顺强势中心的现象。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	4
157	In support of his view, Morley devised a 4-tier classification system of relative importance, which he ascribed to all of the then-known main Maya sites ; many more sites are now known, and his classification system is now seen as an arbitrary one, contradicted in places by the sites' texts which can now be  read.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	5	为了支持他的观点，莫利设计了一个比较重要的4层的阶级系统，他是基于当时发现的全部约116个主要的玛雅遗址来得出这个推论。 如今更多的遗址被发现，因此他所设计的阶级系统被看作是一个主观的系统，与后来发现的遗址上的文字有很大的冲突。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	5
157	Other ideas Morley put forward include the proposal that the ancient Maya were the first in Mesoamerica to domesticate maize ("Zea mays" ssp.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	6	莫利提出的其他观点包括古玛雅人是中部美洲最早种植玉米的人。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	6
157	Recent genetic studies have shown Morley to be largely correct in this, although the beginnings of its domestication  pre-dates the establishment of anything resembling Maya society.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	7	最近遗传学研究表明莫利在这个方面的观点大部分是正确的，虽然开始种植的时间先于任何玛雅社会建立时间。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	7
157	In general, Morley held that the ancient Maya had been the pre-eminent civilization of Mesoamerica, from which other cultures had drawn their influences.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	8	总之，莫利坚持古玛雅文明是中部美洲先进的文明，其他文化都是受它的影响。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	8
157	However, the Maya did also exert a widespread influence over neighboring contemporary cultures, one which was significant and not to be overlooked.	7 ::: 2	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Views on ancient Maya society	9	不过，玛雅在其周边地区同一时代的文化中确实发挥了影响作用，这一点是显著的并且不能被忽视。	7 ::: 1	理论和评价 ::: 关于古玛雅社会观点	9
157	In common with most other Maya scholars, Morley was particularly interested in the mysterious nature of the Maya script.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	0	和大部分玛雅学者一样，莫利对玛雅文字的神秘性有着特殊的兴趣。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	0
157	However, the bulk of the texts and inscriptions still defied all attempts at decipherment, despite much concerted effort.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	1	然而，尽管他们作出了大量的努力，大部分文字和铭文依旧无法解读。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	1
157	He supposed that the Maya writing system was one based chiefly upon ideographic or pictographic principles, and that if present any elements of phoneticism would always be "overshadow[ed]" by the ideographic meaning assigned to each glyph."	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	2	莫利假设玛雅文字系统是基于形意文字或象形文字，而没有语音学的构成。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	2
157	That is to say, in Morley's view each glyph substantially represented words, ideas and concepts "in toto", and did not separately depict the individual language sounds as spoken by the scribes who had written them .	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	3	也就是说，每一个字形代表了全部意义和概念，而这些符号的产生方法与写这些符号的人的发音无关。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	3
157	The convincing evidence which was to overturn this view became known only after Morley's death, starting with Yuri Knorozov's work in the 1950s.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	4	莫利逝世之后，越来越多的证据有力地否认了莫利的观点。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	4
157	Over the next decades other Mayanists such as Proskouriakoff, Michael D. Coe, and David H. Kelley would further expand upon this phonetic line of enquiry, which ran counter to the accepted view but would prove to be ever more fruitful as their work continued.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	5	从1950年代俄罗斯语言学家诺罗索夫的研究开始，在接下来的几十年中，其它玛雅文化研究研究者如普罗斯库里亚科夫、迈克尔·科和戴维·凯利更进一步扩展了语音线的问题，虽然与已经广泛接受的观点相反，但是在接下来的工作中，被证明是卓有成效的。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	5
157	By the mid-1970s, it had become increasingly clear to most that the Maya writing system was a logosyllabic one, a mixture of logograms and phonetic components that included a fully functional syllabary.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	6	1970年代中期，越来越清晰地证明玛雅文字是一种意音文字，一种发音和字型混合在一起构成完整功能的音节文字。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	6

157	Consequently, most of Morley's attempts to advance understanding of the Maya script have been superseded.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	9	因此，大部分莫利推出的理解玛雅文字的方法如今已经不再使用。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	9
157	Morley's particular passion was the study of the Maya calendar and its related inscriptions, and in this respect, he made useful expositions that have withstood later scrutiny.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	10	莫利对于研究玛雅历和相关的铭文有特殊的兴趣，在这个方面，他做出的推理禁得起后来研究的推敲。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	10

157	He was particularly proficient at recovering calendar dates from well-worn and weathered inscriptions, owing to his great familiarity with the various glyphic styles of the "tzolk'in", "haab"' and Long Count elements.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	12	由于非常熟悉的多种雕刻风格的卓尔金历、哈布历、长期积日制历法 ，因此他特别精通复原饱经风霜已经残缺的碑铭上的日历日期。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	12
157	Yet in his focus on calendric details, he would often overlook or even neglect the documentation of other non-calendric aspects of the Maya script; the comprehensiveness of some of his publications suffered much as a result.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	13	他主要关注日历的细节，因而经常忽略甚至否认玛雅文字其它非日历的部分，因此他的一些著作的综合性也受到了影响。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	13
157	Some leading figures from a later generation of Mayanists would come to regard his publications as being inferior in detail and scope to that of his predecessors, such as Teoberto Maler and Alfred Maudslay — poorer quality reproductions, omitted texts, sometimes inaccurate drawings.	7 ::: 3	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Maya writing	14	他之后的玛雅文化学者的一些重要人物认为他的著作比起他的前辈，如特奥伯托·马勒和阿尔弗雷德·莫斯莱，在细节和范围上有所不足，低质量的重复，省略的文字，还有一些不正确的插图。	7 ::: 2	理论和评价 ::: 玛雅文字	14

157	Some have even speculated that his life and exploits may have provided some of the inspiration for the character of Indiana Jones in the Spielberg films; the Carnegie Institute itself mentions that it might also have been Morley's field director at Chichen Itza, Earl Morris.	7 ::: 5	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Summation	4	有些人甚至推测他的生活经历和成就可能给了斯皮尔伯格的电影角色印第安那·琼斯以灵感；卡内基研究所则认为该角色可能来源于莫利在奇琴伊察的野外向导厄尔·莫里斯。	7 ::: 4	理论和评价 ::: 总结	4
157	Sylvanus Morley was also to be remembered as a spokesman and representative of the Maya peoples, among whom he spent so much of his time, and who otherwise lacked the means to directly address some of their concerns with the wider public.	7 ::: 5	Theories and retrospective assessment ::: Summation	5	西尔韦纳斯·莫利作为发言人和代表也被玛雅人所怀念，他与他们共同度过了很多时光，否则他们就缺少了向外界表达一些他们自己想法的直接方式。	7 ::: 4	理论和评价 ::: 总结	5

159	For him, action could be expressed mathematically as the product of the mass of the body involved, the distance it had travelled and the velocity at which it was travelling.	3	Least action principle	0	他定義作用量為物體的質量，移動距離，與移動速度的乘積。	2	最小作用量原理	0
159	In 1741, he gave a paper to the Paris Academy of Sciences, "Loi du repos des corps", .	3	Least action principle	1	1741年，莫佩爾蒂在巴黎科學院發表了一篇論文〈靜止物體定律〉。	2	最小作用量原理	1
159	In it he showed that a system of bodies at rest tends to reach a position in which any change would create the smallest possible change in a quantity that he argued could be assimilated to action.	3	Least action principle	2	他表明，在一個系統裏，所有呈靜止狀態的物體，假若有任何變化，產生的運動，趨向於作用量的最小改變。	2	最小作用量原理	2
159	In 1744, in another paper to the Paris Academy, he gave his "Accord de plusieurs lois naturelles qui avaient paru jusqu'ici incompatibles"  to show that the behaviour of light during refraction – when it bends on entering a new medium – was such that the total path it followed, from a point in the first medium to a point in the second, minimised a quantity which he again assimilated to action.	3	Least action principle	3	在另一篇於1744年，在巴黎科學院發表的論文中，他提出了〈幾種以前互不相容的自然定律的合一論〉：光折射的路徑，從一種介質到另一種介質，是作用量的最小值。	2	最小作用量原理	3
159	Finally, in 1746 he gave a further paper, the "Loix du mouvement et du repos" , this time to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, which showed that point masses also minimise action.	3	Least action principle	4	1746年，莫佩爾蒂更進一步地在伯林科學院發表了論文〈運動與靜止定律〉。 他表明，質點的運動也趨向於最小作用量。	2	最小作用量原理	4
159	Point masses are bodies that can be treated for the purposes of analysis as being a certain amount of matter  concentrated at a single point.	3	Least action principle	5	為了便於分析，物體的全部質量可以被視為集中於一點，稱這一點為質點。	2	最小作用量原理	5
159	A major debate in the early part of the eighteenth century concerned the behaviour of such bodies in collisions.	3	Least action principle	6	在十八世紀前期，關於質點經碰撞後的可能發生狀況，有很大的爭論。	2	最小作用量原理	6
159	Cartesian and Newtonian physicists argued that in their collisions, point masses conserved both momentum and relative velocity.	3	Least action principle	7	笛卡兒派與牛頓派物理學家認為，在碰撞下，幾個質點的總動量與相對速度是恆定的。	2	最小作用量原理	7
159	Why did the velocity appear twice in this quantity, as squaring it suggests?	3	Least action principle	8	為什麼速度在活力這數量裏出現兩次？	2	最小作用量原理	8
159	This was anathema to Cartesians and Newtonians.	3	Least action principle	9	笛卡兒派與牛頓派則認為這辯理簡直是胡言。	2	最小作用量原理	9
159	For Maupertuis, however, it was important to retain the concept of the hard body.	3	Least action principle	10	對於莫佩爾蒂而言，硬物體的概念是很重要的。	2	最小作用量原理	10
159	And the beauty of his principle of least action was that it applied just as well to hard and elastic bodies.	3	Least action principle	11	他提出的最小作用量原理有一個很特別的優點：這原理可以應用於硬物體與彈性物體。	2	最小作用量原理	11
159	Since he had shown that the principle also applied to systems of bodies at rest and to light, it seemed that it was truly universal.	3	Least action principle	12	又可以應用於靜止狀態的物體與光，似乎，這原理可以廣泛的應用於宇宙的每一個角落。	2	最小作用量原理	12
159	Leibniz had already shown that this quantity is likely to be either minimised "or maximised" in natural phenomena.	3	Least action principle	13	事實上，萊布尼茨證明過，在大自然現象中，這物理量有可能趨向最小值，也有同樣的可能趨向最大值。	2	最小作用量原理	13

184	Using her diaries and letters from her journey to Scandinavia, Wollstonecraft wrote a rumination on her travels and her relationship—"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" —in which, among other things, she celebrated motherhood.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	9	在前往斯堪的纳维亚半岛的途中，沃斯通克拉夫特在其所书写的日记与信件里对她的旅程及她的关系进行了反思——并在后来集结成册出版了《瑞典、挪威和丹麦短居书简》——除了这些内容外，她还为自己成为母亲感到庆幸。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	9
184	Her maternal connection to her daughter prompted her to reflect on a woman's place in the world:   You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her—I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	10	而与女儿的母性联系让她去思考了女性在世界上的地位：   同样作为女性，我对她十分珍爱——这不只出于母亲的母爱与挂念，还出于我对她将在情欲上附属与受压迫地位的思考。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	10
184	I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	11	我担心她会被迫因为自己的本性而放弃其心灵，抑或为了心灵而牺牲其本性。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	11
184	With trembling hand I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard—I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit—Hapless woman!	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	12	我小心翼翼地去培养自己的感性，并珍视感情的精巧微妙，时时唯恐在玫瑰前面带羞涩，削尖利刺去防范那些必须警惕的胸膛——我害怕去打开她的内心，唯恐会使她不适应她所居住的这个世界——不幸的女人！	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	12

184	Wollstonecraft lavished love and attention on her daughter.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	14	沃斯通克拉夫特将她的爱与关心倾注在她的女儿身上。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	14
184	She began two books, drawn from her own experience, related to Fanny's care: a parenting manual entitled "Letters on the Management of Infants" and a reading primer entitled "Lessons".	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	15	在其写作的两本关于抚育范妮的书中，她描述出了自己的体验：一本是育子手册《关于婴儿养育的信件》，另一本是识字课本《课程》。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	15
184	In one section of "Lessons", she describes weaning:   When you were hungry, you began to cry, because you could not speak.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	16	在《课程》的其中一节里，她这样描述断奶的过程：   当你饥饿时，你就开始哭闹，因为你还不会说话。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	16
184	You were seven months without teeth, always sucking.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	17	7个月大的你还没长出牙齿，还没有断奶。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	17
184	But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	18	但当你一岁后，你便开始咬面包皮了。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	18
184	It was not long before another came pop.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	19	不久后你又喜欢上别的东西了。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	19
184	At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	20	在10个月时，你长出了四颗漂亮雪白的牙齿，你用它们来咬我。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	20
184	Poor mamma!	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	21	可怜的妈妈！	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	21

184	She is not naughty, yet she hurts me.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	24	她并不淘气，但她还是弄痛了我。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	24
184	I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	25	我给了她一片面包皮，同时我也得寻找替代的乳汁。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	25
184	In 1797, Wollstonecraft fell in love with and married the philosopher William Godwin .	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	26	1797年，沃斯通克拉夫特爱上了哲学家威廉·戈德温，并在怀上他的一个孩子后与他结婚。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	26
184	Godwin grew to love Fanny during his affair with Wollstonecraft; he brought her back a mug from Josiah Wedgwood's pottery factory with an "F" on it that delighted both mother and daughter.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	27	在与沃斯通克拉夫特保持亲密关系时，戈德温也渐渐爱上了范妮；他从乔赛亚·韦奇伍德的陶器工坊给范妮带回了一只印着“F”的马克杯，这让母女俩都很开心。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	27

184	Her copy of Wollstonecraft's only completed children's book, "Original Stories from Real Life" , has the initials "F. G." written in large print in it.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	30	在她拥有的那本《真实生活的原创故事》上，也写着其姓名的缩写“F. G.”。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	30
184	According to the dominant interpretation of Godwin's diary, it was not until Fanny turned twelve that she was informed in an important conversation with Godwin that he was not her natural father.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	31	根据戈德温日记中的描述，直到范妮满12岁时，戈德温才在一场与她的重要的对话中告诉她，他并不是她的生父。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	31
184	In the only biography of Fanny, Janet Todd disputes this reading, arguing instead that the conversation was about Fanny's future.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	32	然而，在范妮唯一的一部传记中，珍妮特·托德对这一解释抱持怀疑，并认为这场对话里谈到的应该是范妮的将来。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	32
184	She finds it unlikely that Fanny would have been unaware of her origins in the open and liberal Godwin household.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	33	她觉得在开放和自由的戈德温家庭中，范妮不知道自己的亲生父亲是不大可能的。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	33
184	After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin and Joseph Johnson, Wollstonecraft's publisher and close friend, contacted Fanny's father, but he was uninterested in raising his child.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	34	在沃斯通克拉夫特死后，戈德温与沃斯通克拉夫特的出版商及友人约瑟夫·约翰逊 联系到了范妮的父亲，但他却对抚养自己的女儿不感兴趣。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	34
184	Wollstonecraft's two sisters, Eliza Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft, Fanny's only two living female relatives, were anxious to care for her; Godwin, disliking them, turned down their offer.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	35	沃斯通克拉夫特的两个妹妹伊利莎·毕晓普与埃弗里娜·沃斯通克拉夫特是范妮唯一在世的两位女性亲戚，她们很希望能负责照顾范妮；但对她们不抱好感的戈德温却拒绝了她们的请求。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	35
184	Several times throughout Fanny's childhood Wollstonecraft's sisters asked Godwin to allow them to raise their niece and each time he refused.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	36	在范妮的孩童时期里，沃斯通克拉夫特的妹妹们还曾多次要求戈德温让她们抚育自己的甥女，但都被他拒绝了。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	36
184	Godwin himself did not seem particularly ready for parenthood and he now had two small children to raise and no steady source of income.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	37	然而，戈德温也没有为此作好应有的准备，他当时要抚育两个孩子，而他却还没有稳定的收入。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	37
184	However, he was determined to care for them.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	38	但即便这样，他依旧下定决心要由自己来养育她们。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	38
184	During these early years of Fanny's life, Joseph Johnson served as an "unofficial trustee" for her as he had occasionally for her mother.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	39	在范妮的早年生活中，约瑟夫·约翰逊是她的“非正式的托管人”，就像他以前帮助她的母亲那样。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	39
184	He even willed her £200, but Godwin owed Johnson so much money upon his death in 1809 that Johnson's heirs demanded Godwin pay the money back as part of his arrears.	1 ::: 2	Life ::: Infancy and early childhood	40	他甚至遗赠给范妮200英镑，并一直由戈德温所保管。 直到1809年约翰逊死后，这笔钱才被作为欠款的一部分归还给了约翰逊的遗产继承人。	1 ::: 2	生活 ::: 幼年与童年早期	40
184	Although Godwin was fond of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care for them.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	0	虽然戈德温十分喜爱他的女儿们，但他在很多方面都没有为照顾她们作好准备。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	0
184	As Todd explains, he was constantly annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	1	如同托德解释的那样，他的工作需要安静的环境，但女儿们的喧闹声却常常让他烦恼生气。 然而，当他前往都柏林去拜访沃斯通克拉夫特的妹妹时，他却对女儿们无比思念，并经常写信给她们。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	1
184	However, when he took a trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	2	然而，当他前往都柏林去拜访沃斯通克拉夫特的妹妹时，他却对女儿们无比思念，并经常写信给她们。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	2
184	On 21 December 1801, when Fanny was seven, Godwin married Mary Jane Clairmont, a neighbour with two children of her own: three-year-old Claire and six-year-old Charles.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	3	1801年12月21日，在范妮7岁时，戈德温与邻居玛丽·简·克莱尔蒙特结婚，她带来了她的两个孩子：三岁大的克莱尔与六岁大的查尔斯。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	3
184	She had never been married and was looking, like Godwin, for financial stability.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	4	她在此前从未结过婚，并同戈德温一样在寻求稳定的经济来源。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	4
184	Although Clairmont was well-educated and well-travelled, most of Godwin's friends despised her, finding her vulgar and dishonest.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	5	虽然克莱尔蒙特接受过良好的教育并游历丰富，但戈德温的许多朋友都十分厌恶她，认为她庸俗且不诚实。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	5
184	They were astonished that Godwin could replace Mary Wollstonecraft with her.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	6	他们惊讶于克莱尔蒙特居然能取代玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特当年的位置。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	6
184	Fanny and her half-sister Mary disliked their stepmother and complained that she preferred her own children to them.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	7	范妮与她的同母异父妹妹玛丽都不喜欢她们的继母，并抱怨她喜欢自己的子女多过她们。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	7
184	On 28 March 1803, baby William was born to the couple.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	8	1803年3月28日，戈德温与克莱尔蒙特妇生下了一个儿子威廉。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	8
184	Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did not agree with her that women should receive the same education as men.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	9	虽然戈德温十分赞赏沃斯通克拉夫特的文笔，但他并不同意她的女性应与男性接受相同教育的观点。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	9
184	Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's "Fabulous Histories"  and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's "Lessons for Children" , but, according to Todd, he did not take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	10	因此，他有时会给范妮与玛丽阅读萨拉·特里默的《神话史》和安娜·拉埃蒂茨娅·巴鲍德的《儿童启蒙教程》。不过，据托德的描述，戈德温并没有在其女儿的教育上下多大工夫，并且漠视了沃斯通克拉夫特为范妮写的书。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	10
184	William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in "The Enquirer" reflect these discussions.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	11	然而，在威廉·圣克莱尔写的戈德温与雪莱家族的传记中，他提到戈德温与沃斯通克拉夫特曾在子女的教育上进行过广泛深入的探讨；后来，这些讨论反映在了戈德温的《问询者 》一书里。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	11
184	He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	12	他还举证说，在沃斯通克拉夫特死后，戈德温给她以前的一位学生芒卡谢尔小姐写了一封信，请教她应如何抚养和教育他的两个女儿。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	12
184	In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that "everything we know about his daughter's [Mary's and presumably Fanny's] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	13	在米兰达·西摩写的玛丽·雪莱的传记里，她对圣克莱尔的观点也表示认同，提到：“就我们所知的其女儿早年的每一件事，都传达着她是按其母亲赞成的方式接受教育的这一观点”，并还指出，她有着一位担任家庭教师会说法语的继母，以及一位根据自己教育子女的经历写作童书的父亲。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	13
184	It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	14	戈德温家女儿们的教育主要由新的戈德温太太负责，但她却偏爱给自己的女儿传授更多的知识，其中包括法语。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	14
184	Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	15	在继父再婚后，范妮便没有再接受过正规的教育。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	15
184	Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager".	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	16	不过，戈德温的一位早期传记作者基根·保罗用以下的这些优点来描述成年后的范妮：“有教养、精神充沛、聪明、优秀的信件作者、出色的家务管理者”。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	16
184	Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	17	范妮擅长于绘画，并接受过音乐教育。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	17
184	Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	18	虽然戈德温个人信仰无神论，但他還是讓孩子們去教堂禮拜。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	18
184	The Godwins were constantly in debt, so Godwin returned to writing to support the family.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	19	由于家庭经常需要举债度日，戈德温不得不重新开始写作以支持他的家庭。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	19
184	He and his wife started a "Juvenile Library" for which he wrote children's books.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	20	他与妻子还为其写作的童书建立了一所“儿童书屋”。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	20
184	In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	21	1807年范妮13岁时，他们从当年戈德温与沃斯通克拉夫特居住的波利根楼搬到了斯金纳街41号，毗邻于售卖图书的克拉肯韦尔区。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	21
184	This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	22	这次搬家让戈德温家庭远离了空气新鲜的郊区，而来到了肮脏、空气混浊的伦敦街区中。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	22
184	Although initially successful, the business gradually failed.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	23	他们的生意最初还算成功，但不久后便衰落了下去。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	23
184	The Godwins also continued to borrow more money than they could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	24	戈德温家庭依然不得不向一些慷慨的朋友借贷超过他们还款能力的债务，譬如出版商约瑟夫·约翰逊 及戈德温的一位爱好者弗朗西斯·普莱斯。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	24
184	As Fanny Imlay grew up, her father increasingly relied on her to placate tradespeople who demanded bills be paid and to solicit money from men such as Place.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	25	随着范妮·伊姆利的长大，戈德温愈发地需要她去安抚催帐的商人，并向普莱斯等人借钱。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	25
184	According to Todd and Seymour, Imlay believed in Godwin's theory that great thinkers and artists should be supported by patrons and she believed Godwin to be both a great novelist and a great philosopher.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	26	根据托德与西摩的描述，范妮对戈德温的理论深信不疑，认为伟大的思想家与艺术家需要赞助人的支持来维持生活，并相信戈德温就是一位伟大的小说家与哲学家。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	26
184	Throughout her life, she wrote letters asking Place and others for money to support Godwin's "genius" and she helped run the household so that he could work.	1 ::: 3	Life ::: Childhood	27	在她的一生中，她不断地给普莱斯等人写信，请求他们用金钱来支持戈德温的“天才”；她还努力协助家庭事务，以让戈德温能专注于他的工作。	1 ::: 3	生活 ::: 童年	27
184	Mary, my daughter, is the reverse of her in many particulars.	1 ::: 4	Life ::: Teenage years	0	我的女儿玛丽在许多方面与她则截然不同。	1 ::: 4	生活 ::: 少年	0

184	The intellectual world of the girls was widened by their exposure to the literary and political circles in which Godwin moved.	1 ::: 4	Life ::: Teenage years	4	受戈德温所处的文学与政治圈的影响，两个女孩的理性世界都得到了拓展。	1 ::: 4	生活 ::: 少年	4
184	For example, during former American vice-president Aaron Burr's self-imposed exile from the United States after his acquittal on treason charges, he often spent time with the Godwins.	1 ::: 4	Life ::: Teenage years	5	譬如，在前美国副总统亚伦·伯尔的叛国罪被宣判无罪后，他度过了一段自我流放的旅程；在此期间，他常会与戈德温家庭在一起。	1 ::: 4	生活 ::: 少年	5

184	Imlay was sent to Wales in May of that year; Todd speculates that Godwin was trying to separate her from Shelley while Seymour hints that Mrs Godwin was trying to improve her despondent mood.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	8	这一年5月，范妮被送到了威尔士；托德推测这可能是因为戈德温想要拆散她与雪莱的关系；但西摩却暗示说，戈德温太太正在试图改善她的悲观情绪。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	8
184	Meanwhile, the Godwin household became even more uncomfortable as Godwin sank further into debt and as relations between Mary and her stepmother became increasingly hostile.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	9	在此期间，戈德温欠下了更多的债务，而玛丽与其继母之间的关系也日益敌对，这让戈德温家庭的气氛更趋于恶劣。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	9

184	Frustrated with the entire situation, Mary Godwin, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont ran off to Europe together on 28 June 1814.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	13	在整件事情上遭遇挫折的玛丽·戈德温、雪莱与克莱尔·克莱尔蒙特三人，于1814年6月28日结伴逃到了欧洲大陆。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	13
184	Godwin hurriedly summoned Imlay home from Wales to help him handle the situation.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	14	戈德温急忙将范妮从威尔士召回家里，以协助他控制该局面。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	14

184	Life in the Godwin household became increasingly strained.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	18	原本已经十分紧张的戈德温家庭濒临崩溃。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	18
184	When Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and Shelley returned from the Continent in September 1814, they took a house together in London, enraging Godwin still further.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	19	1814年9月，当玛丽·戈德温、克莱尔·克莱尔蒙特与雪莱从欧洲大陆回到英国后，他们在伦敦买下了一栋房子并定居下来，这进一步激怒了戈德温。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	19
184	Imlay felt pulled between the two households: she felt loyal both to her sisters and to her father.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	20	范妮在两个家庭间感到十分为难：她既忠于她的妹妹，也忠于她的父亲。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	20
184	Both despised her decision not to choose a side in the family drama.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	21	而两方都轻视了她在这场家庭纠纷中不愿支持任何一方的决定。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	21
184	As Seymour explains, Imlay was in a difficult position: the Godwin household felt Shelley was a dangerous influence and the Shelley household ridiculed her fear of violating social conventions.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	22	就像西摩解释的那样，范妮处于一个非常困难的境地：戈德温家庭认为雪莱对她有着危险的影响，而雪莱家庭则奚落她不敢违犯社会习俗。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	22
184	Also, her aunts were considering her for a teaching position at this time, but were reluctant because of Godwin's shocking "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" .	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	23	同时，她的几位阿姨也在考虑为她谋求一个教师的职业，但却由于戈德温《女权辩护作者传》的负面影响而难以进行。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	23
184	Seymour writes, the "few timid visits Fanny made to see Mary and [Claire] in London were acts of great courage; she got little thanks for them".	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	24	西摩这样写道：“少数人胆怯地拜访了范妮，以能同玛丽和克莱尔见面——这件事在伦敦需要极大的勇气；而这些人对她并没有表达什么感谢之言”。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	24
184	Although instructed by Godwin not to speak to Shelley and her sisters, Imlay warned them of creditors who knew of Shelley's return .	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	25	虽然戈德温命令她不得同她的妹妹及雪莱对话，但范妮仍将债权人知道雪莱返回的消息通告给了他们。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	25
184	Her attempts to persuade Clairmont to return to the Godwins' convinced Shelley that she was of Godwin's party and he began to distrust her.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	26	然而，她劝说克莱尔蒙特返回戈德温家的举动，导致雪莱相信她是戈德温那边的人，从而对她产生了不信任感。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	26
184	Imlay was also still responsible for soliciting money from Shelley in order to repay her father's debts; despite Shelley's essential elopement with two of his daughters, Godwin agreed to accept £1,200 from Shelley.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	27	范妮同时还要负责从雪莱那里要钱，来偿还她父亲欠下的债务；而尽管雪莱在本质上已同他的两个女儿私奔，但戈德温依然接受了雪莱的1,200英镑。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	27
184	When Mary Godwin gave birth to a daughter in February 1815, she immediately sent for Imlay, particularly as both she and the infant were ill. Godwin chastised Imlay for disobeying his orders not to see her half-sister and her misery increased.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	28	1815年，当玛丽·戈德温生下一女后，她便直接送给范妮抚养，因为在当时她与婴儿都十分病弱。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	28
184	After the death of the child, Imlay paid more frequent visits to the couple.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	29	因为违犯了不准与其妹妹见面的禁令，戈德温惩罚了范妮，这让她的痛苦进一步加剧。 在新生儿夭折后，范妮更加频繁地去拜访雪莱他们。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	29
184	Soon after, Clairmont became a lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	30	不久之后，克莱尔成为了浪漫主义诗人拜伦的爱人；1816年1月24日，玛丽与雪莱生下了他们的第二个孩子，并取名为其父亲戈德温的名字“威廉”。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	30
184	In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	31	2月，范妮与定居于毕晓普斯盖特区的雪莱一家见面。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	31
184	Godwin's debts continued to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	32	戈德温的债务在继续地上升，而尽管他需要雪莱资助他的钱财，但他依旧拒绝同雪莱或玛丽见面。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	32
184	At this time, Charles Clairmont , frustrated with the tension in the Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	33	在这个时候，厌倦了戈德温家庭紧张气氛的查尔斯·克莱尔蒙特出走到了法国，并拒绝再向自己的家庭提供帮助。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	33
184	At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	34	几乎在同时，克莱尔、玛丽与雪莱也前往了欧洲大陆去寻找拜伦。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	34
184	Godwin was aghast.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	35	戈德温被这一情形惊呆了。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	35
184	He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	36	他需要雪莱的钱财来维系生活；而当公众了解到戈德温的家人竟与放荡的拜伦为伍时，其家庭的名誉也染上了污点。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	36
184	Amidst all of this family turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	37	在所有的这些家庭纠纷中，范妮依然会抽出时间来思考一些更大的社会议题。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	37
184	The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin in the summer of 1816 and he and Imlay discussed the plight of the working poor in Britain.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	38	1816年夏天，空想社会主义者罗伯特·欧文拜访了戈德温，并与范妮就英国工人穷困的现状进行了一些讨论。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	38
184	She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	39	范妮对欧文的许多观点表示认可，但她并没有完全地接受。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	39
184	She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	40	她认为，欧文的乌托邦计划太过于“异想天开”，因为它严重地依赖于富人们愿意分享自己财富的善意。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	40
184	That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet her for the first time and told her stories of her mother.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	41	在同一个夏天，乔治·布拉德——即当年沃斯通克拉夫特亲密好友范妮·布拉德的兄弟——在第一时间拜访了她，并告诉了她不少关于其母亲的故事。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	41
184	After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to "such a mother"...	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	42	在这次会面后，她在写给玛丽和雪莱的信中提到：“我已下定决心，我决不能玷污了"这样的一位母亲"……”。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	42
184	I have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's  to love and esteem me" [emphasis in original].	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	43	我发现，如果我努力地去克服我的缺点，我将会找到真爱并赢得尊重。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	43
184	Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley had left for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major argument and no chance to come to a reconciliation.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	44	在玛丽、克莱尔与雪莱前往欧洲大陆之前，范妮与玛丽之间的争吵十分严重，且并未出现有可供她们和解的机会。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	44
184	Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London was palpable.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	45	范妮在写给玛丽的信件中试图缓和这种关系，而她独处伦敦的孤独感也跃然纸上。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	45
184	She wrote to Mary of "the dreadful state of mind I generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of".	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	46	她在写给玛丽的信中提到：“我为这糟透了的心理状态而苦恼，为摆脱它我竭尽全力却又徒劳无助”。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	46
184	Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	47	许多学者将范妮日益忧愁的状况归因于戈德温太太对她所持有的敌意。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	47
184	Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same "extreme depression to which her mother had been subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family".	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	48	基根与其他人认为，范妮与其母亲当年一样，遭受到了极度的沮丧，并影响到了家庭的其他成员。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	48
184	Wandering amongst the mountains of Switzerland, frustrated with her relationship with Shelley, and engrossed by the writing of "Frankenstein", her sister was unsympathetic.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	49	但是，玛丽当时正漫步于瑞士的群山之间，为她与雪莱之间的关系烦恼不已，并全神贯注于《弗兰肯斯坦》的写作，而没有关心过范妮当时的情况。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	49
184	The group returned from the Continent, with a pregnant Clairmont, and settled in Bath .	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	50	在克莱尔怀孕后，他们从欧洲大陆回到了英国，并定居于巴斯。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	50
184	Imlay saw Shelley twice in September 1816; according to Todd's interpretation of Fanny's letters, Fanny had earlier tried to solicit an invitation to join the group in Europe and she repeated these appeals when she saw Shelley in London.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	51	1816年9月，范妮与雪莱有两次见面；根据托德对范妮信件的解读，在起初，范妮曾请求雪莱让她与他们一同前往欧洲，并在伦敦看见雪莱后一再请求他。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	51
184	Todd believes that Imlay begged to be allowed to stay with them because life in Godwin's house was unbearable, with the constant financial worries and Mrs Godwin's insistent haranguing, and that Shelley refused, concerned with anyone learning about Clairmont's condition, most of all someone he believed might inform Godwin .	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	52	托德认为，范妮之所以乞求雪莱让她与他们呆在一起，是因为戈德温家庭的生活已令其不堪承受：她需要面对常年累月的经济问题以及戈德温持续不断的指责。 然而，雪莱因为考虑到不能让任何人知道——特别是不能让戈德温知道——克莱尔的情况，而拒绝了她的请求。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	52
184	After Shelley left, Todd explains that Imlay wrote to Mary "to make clear again her longing to be rescued".	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Teenage years ::: Percy, Mary, and Claire	53	雪莱离开后，范妮写信给玛丽，再次向她解释了她渴望得到营救的心情。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生活 ::: 少年 ::: 珀西、玛丽与克莱尔	53
184	It is only poets that are eternal benefactors of their fellow creatures—& the real ones never fail of giving us the highest degree of pleasure we are capable of ... they are in my oppinion  nature & art united—& as such never failing.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	0	在他们的同类中，只有诗人是永久的施舍者——他们在给予我们至高无上的愉悦上从未令人失望……在我看来，他们是自然与艺术的结合——而它们亦同样从未令人失望。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	0
184	In early October 1816, Imlay left Godwin's house in London and committed suicide on 9 October  by taking an overdose of laudanum at an inn in Swansea, Wales; she was 22.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	1	在1816年10月上旬，范妮离开了戈德温在伦敦的房子。 10月9日，范妮在南威尔士斯旺西的一家旅馆中，因服用过量的鸦片酊而自杀身亡，时年22岁。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	1
184	The details surrounding her death and her motivations are disputed.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	2	直至今天，有关她死亡的细节及其自杀的动机依然存有争议。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	2
184	Most of the letters regarding the incident were destroyed or are missing.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	3	与这次事件有关的绝大多数信件都已遗失或被销毁。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	3
184	In his 1965 article "Fanny Godwin's Suicide Re-examined", B. R. Pollin lays out the major theories that had been put forward regarding her suicide and which continue to be used today: Pollin dismisses the first of these, as have most later biographers, arguing that Imlay had access to her mother's writings and Godwin's "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" which openly discuss the circumstances of her birth.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	4	在波林于1965年发表的论文范妮·戈德温自杀的重新调查中，他列举出了主要的几项延续至今的推测： :::::波林排除了上述的第一项，绝大多数后来的传记作家都认为范妮可以通过阅读其母亲的著作以及戈德温的《女权辩护作者传》来了解到她自己的身世。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	4
184	Imlay herself even makes this distinction in letters to her half-sister Mary Godwin.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	5	范妮自己甚至还在写给其同母异父妹妹玛丽的一封信中，提到这个不同点。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	5
184	Pollin is also sceptical of the second explanation, pointing to Imlay's letter to Mary of 3 October 1816 in which she defended her step-mother: "Mrs. Godwin would never do either of you a deliberate injury.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	6	此外，波林还对第二个解释抱持怀疑的态度，指出，范妮在1816年10月3日寄给玛丽的信中还在为她的继母作辩护：“戈德温太太绝不会对你们中的任一个作出蓄意的伤害。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	6
184	Mamma and I are not great friends, but always alive to her virtues, I am anxious to defend her from a charge so foreign to her character."	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	7	妈妈和我并不是很好的朋友，但我一直都感受得到她的正直，我希望这能让她避免受到与她的人格无关的指责。”	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	7
184	Pollin finds no evidence that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been "in contemplation", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	8	波林发现，没有证据足以支持范妮曾拒绝了她阿姨的学校为其提供的职位这一说法。 就像戈德温后来在信件中提到的那样，为她谋取职位的计划有可能还在“计划当中”。 不过，西摩认为这一解释尚有其可能性。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	8
184	St Clair claims that Imlay was on her way to join her maternal aunts in Ireland when she decided to commit suicide.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	9	圣克莱尔认为，范妮是在前往爱尔兰拜访其阿姨的途中自杀的。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	9
184	He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to see if she could be a teacher in their school.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	10	他相信这次行程是为了对她进行试用，以确保她能胜任其教师一职。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	10
184	Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	11	但是，另一位当代的戈德温传记作家理查德·霍姆斯排除了这一解释的可能性。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	11
184	In his survey of the letters of the Godwins and the Shelleys, Pollin comes to the conclusion that Imlay was not depressive.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	12	在对戈德温与雪莱家庭的信件进行调查后，波林得出了范妮在当时并不忧郁的结论。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	12
184	She is frequently described as happy and looking toward the future and describes herself this way.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	13	在信件中，她经常被描述为十分地快乐，对未来充满希望，并用这种方式来描述她自己。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	13
184	The mentions of melancholia and sadness are specific and related to particular events and illness.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	14	对精神忧郁与悲伤的提及并不普遍，且只与特定事件与疾病有关。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	14
184	Richard Holmes, in his biography of Percy Shelley, argues that "her agonizing and loveless suspension between the Godwin and Shelley households was clearly the root circumstance" of her suicide.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	15	然而，在理查德·霍姆斯对雪莱的传记中，提到“在戈德温与雪莱家庭间徘徊的苦恼与无爱显然是她最根本原因”	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	15
184	Locke argues that "most probably because she could absorb no more of the miseries of Skinner Street, her father's inability to pay his debts or write his books, her mother's unending irritability and spitefulness", all of which she blamed on herself, she committed suicide.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	16	洛克认为，“很有可能是因为她不能再忍受住在斯金纳街的更多痛苦：她的父亲既无法还债也写不出书来，而她的母亲又在不停地刁难折磨她”，而她将这些痛苦的原因归诸于她自身，因此不堪忍受而自杀。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	16
184	Pollin largely agrees with Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he "somehow failed her", causing her to commit suicide.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	17	波林在很大程度上都对托德的观点表示认同：即推测当范妮在巴斯见到雪莱后，雪莱“以某种方式让她感到了失望”，这导致了她的自杀。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	17
184	Seymour and others speculate that Shelley's only failure was to live up to his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by those who have the worth to give".	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	18	然而，西摩与其他人则推测说，雪莱唯一的失败是没有履行他对戈德温的经济许诺，而正是这个原因将范妮逼上了绝路；范妮及其父亲，都对“伟人有着由拥有财产的人来养活的绝对权利”的说法深信不疑。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	18
184	Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	19	在另一方面，托德也对波林的观点表示认可，并推测范妮去见了玛丽与雪莱。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	19
184	Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	20	托德认为，范妮对雪莱有着情感上的依靠，并觉得他的家是她唯一的避风港。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	20
184	Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	21	通过对雪莱部分可能写于范妮死后的诗作的拼接，托德得出了以下结论：范妮曾在巴斯与雪莱见过面，但雪莱拒绝了她的请求，因为他想要保护克莱尔与他自己的名誉。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	21
184	Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials "M.W. ", and the nicest clothes she owned.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	22	托德还提到，范妮还穿走了其生母的紧身胸衣，上面绣着“M.W.”的姓名缩写，这是她最漂亮的一件衣服。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	22
184	She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	23	她在自杀前还戴上了雪莱从日内瓦寄给她的瑞士金表，颈上也挂着一串项链，想在死后能留下一个较好的印象。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	23
184	After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.	2 ::: 1	Death ::: Theories	24	托德总结道，在雪莱拒绝她以后，她已经打定了自杀的决心。	2 ::: 1	死亡 ::: 推测	24
184	On the night of 9 October, Imlay checked into the Mackworth Arms Inn in Swansea and instructed the chambermaid not to disturb her.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	0	10月9日的夜里，范妮寄居于斯旺西的麦克沃思·阿姆斯旅店，并要求服务员不要打扰她。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	0
184	The same night Mary Godwin, staying in Bath with Shelley, received a letter Imlay had mailed earlier from Bristol.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	1	也在这一夜，与雪莱一同居住在巴斯的玛丽收到了范妮早前从布里斯托尔寄出的一封信。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	1
184	Her father in London also received a letter.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	2	而她住在伦敦的父亲也收到了一封信。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	2
184	The alarming nature of the letters prompted both Godwin and Shelley to set out for Bristol at once .	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	3	对信件内容的警觉让戈德温与雪莱都立即动身前往了布里斯托尔。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	3
184	By the time they tracked her to Swansea on 11 October, they were too late.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	4	他们于11日在斯旺西找到了范妮的踪迹，但已经太迟了。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	4
184	Imlay was found dead in her room on 10 October, having taken a fatal dose of laudanum, and it was only Shelley who stayed to deal with the situation.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	5	10月10日，范妮被发现因服用致命剂量的鸦片酊而死于其房间中。 只有雪莱留下来处理了她的后事。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	5
184	Imlay left behind an unaddressed note, describing herself as "unfortunate", perhaps referring to Mary Wollstonecraft's description of her as "my unfortunate girl" in the note she wrote on "Lessons" before she herself attempted suicide:  I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an end to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate, and whose life has only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurt their health in endeavouring to promote her welfare.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	6	范妮死前留下了一封未署名的笔记，将自己描述为“不幸”的人；这可能与其母亲沃斯通克拉夫特在一次试图自杀前，在其《课程》上写下的“我那不幸女儿”有所联系：  经过长久的思考，我发现我所能达到的最佳结局，是终止这个生来不幸的人的存在：她的生命只会给其身边人带来无尽的痛苦，且为了保障她的幸福而伤害了其他人的健康。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	6
184	Perhaps to hear of my death will give you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that such a creature ever existed as  The note appears to have originally been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could not be identified.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	7	也许听见我的死讯会让你伤心，但你不久后便会祷告上苍，以求忘记这个生命曾经的存在。 她的这份笔记可能最初本写有签名，但在后来，为了避免她的遗体被人认出，签名的部分被撕掉或烧掉了。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	7
184	When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, "The Cambrian", therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	8	因此，在当地报纸《坎布里安报》刊登这则消息时，并没有特别提到她的姓名。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	8
184	At the inquest, Imlay was declared "dead", rather than a suicide or an insanity victim, which saved her body from various indignities.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	9	在验尸后，范妮被宣布为“死亡”，而并非是自杀或精神失常身亡，这避免了其死后的遗体受人侮辱。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	9
184	Todd speculates that Shelley arranged for Imlay to be declared "dead"  and removed any identifying items, such as her name on the note.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	10	托德推测，宣布范妮为“死亡”是雪莱的安排，他还移除了能辨识其身份的物件，譬如她的签名。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	10
184	She also concludes that to protect the rest of the family, he refused to claim her body.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	11	她还总结出，为了保护家庭的其他成员，雪莱没有取回她的遗体。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	11
184	No one else claimed Imlay's body and it was probably buried in a pauper's grave.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	12	也没有其他人认领范妮的遗体，其最后有可能被葬在了贫民墓区里。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	12
184	In fact, Godwin wrote to Percy Shelley:  Do nothing to destroy the obscurity she so much desired, that now rests upon the event.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	13	实际上，戈德温曾写信给雪莱道：   不要破坏她如此想被世人忘掉的愿望，让这件事就这样休止吧。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	13
184	It was, as I said, her last wish ...	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	14	这是，如我所言，是她最后的愿望……	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	14
184	Think what is the situation of my wife & myself, now deprived of all our children but the youngest [William]; & do not expose us to those idle questions, which to a mind in anguish is one of the severest trials.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	15	想想我的妻子与我现在的状况吧，除了幼子，我们所有的儿女都被夺走了；不要让我们面对那些浪费时间的问题，这对一个极度痛苦的心灵是最难承受的折磨。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	15
184	We are at this moment in doubt whether during the first shock we shall not say she is gone to Ireland to her aunts, a thing that had been in contemplation ... What I have most of all in horror is the public papers; & I thank you for your caution as it might act on this. Because suicide was considered scandalous, disreputable, and sinful at the time, which might have damaged Godwin's business, the family told various stories regarding Imlay's death in order to cover up the truth, including that she had gone on vacation, that she had died of a cold in Wales, that she had died of an "inflammatory fever", that she was living with her mother's sisters, or, if forced to admit suicide, that Imlay killed herself because Shelley loved Mary Godwin and not her.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	16	在此时刻，我们开始怀疑，当初是否不该说出要把她送到爱尔兰她阿姨那的话，那件事还在计划当中……我最担心的是公共的报纸；另外，我要感谢你的小心仔细，让这件事按其原本应该的轨迹发展。 在当时，因为自杀是丢脸、耻辱与罪恶的事，可能会对戈德温的事业造成了损害，她的家人编造了许多原因，来掩盖其自杀的真相。 其中包括有：在旅程中因为偶感风寒而在威尔士死亡、因为某种“炎症性的发烧”而死亡、与其母亲的妹妹住在一起等等。当被迫承认其自杀时，则会以范妮的自杀是因为雪莱爱玛丽而不爱她来敷衍。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	16
184	Neither Percy nor Mary mention Imlay's death in their surviving letters from this time.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	17	在这段时间里，雪莱与玛丽在他们来往的信件中都没有提到范妮的死讯。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	17
184	Claire Clairmont claimed in a letter to Byron that Percy became ill because of her death, but as Holmes notes, there is no other evidence for this assertion.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	18	克莱尔·克莱尔蒙特在写给拜伦的一封信中写道，雪莱因为范妮的死而忧郁成病，但据理查德·霍姆斯批注，没有其他的证据能证明这一说法。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	18
184	Yet Locke writes that Shelley told Byron he felt "a far severer anguish" over Imlay's suicide than over Harriet's  suicide just two months later.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	19	然而，洛克提到，雪莱曾告诉拜伦说，他对范妮的自杀要比哈丽雅特在两个月后的自杀还要感到“更为极度的痛苦”。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	19
184	While there is no known image of Imlay, a few months after her death, Shelley penned the poem quoted at the beginning of this article.	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	20	现在还尚未发现有范妮的任何一张画像，但在她死的几个月后，雪莱写下了悼范妮·戈德温一诗来怀念她。	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	20
184	As Seymour writes, "[p]ublished by Mary without comment, it has always been supposed to allude to his last meeting with her half-sister."	2 ::: 2	Death ::: Suicide and aftermath	21	西摩这样写道：“通过玛丽发表并未带任何评论，一直都被认为间接地提到了他与她的同母异父姐姐的最后一次见面。”	2 ::: 2	死亡 ::: 自杀与后事	21

185	Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of John II Komnenos and Piroska of Hungary, so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father.	1	Accession to the throne	0	曼努埃尔·科穆宁是约翰二世与皇后匈牙利的伊琳娜的第四子，所以他似乎并不可能继承皇位。	1	继承皇位	0

185	Yet his succession was by no means assured: At his father's deathbed in the wilds of Cilicia far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible.	1	Accession to the throne	4	然而曼努埃尔的继位并非四平八稳，他的父亲死在了远离君士坦丁堡的奇里乞亚荒野，他认为应该尽快返回首都。	1	继承皇位	4

185	Swiftly, he dispatched the "megas domestikos" John Axouch ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the Great Palace with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia.	1	Accession to the throne	6	他立即派父亲的挚友，大统领John Axouch在他之前前往首都去逮捕他最危险的潜在竞争对手——他的兄长伊萨克，因为伊萨克正居住在大皇宫并且可以立即掌控皇帝登基的礼服与大量财富。	1	继承皇位	6
185	Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor's death had reached it.

185	This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame,  precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests.	2 ::: 3	Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon ::: Arrival of the Crusaders	5	这一谨慎的行动经过深思熟虑，但十字军在行军过程中还是发生了许多事端，这激发了法兰克人与希腊人之间的敌意；双方互相责备，也导致了曼努埃尔和他的客人间的矛盾。	2 ::: 1 ::: 3	对外 ::: 与十字军国家的关系 ::: 第二次十字军东征	5

185	The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to Damalis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.	2 ::: 3	Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon ::: Arrival of the Crusaders	9	最终拜占庭军队击败了德意志十字军，这迫使十字军打消进入君士坦丁堡的念头并迫使康拉德同意带领他的军队加速渡过博斯普鲁斯海峡前往亚洲沿岸的Damlis。	2 ::: 1 ::: 3	对外 ::: 与十字军国家的关系 ::: 第二次十字军东征	9

185	Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.	6 ::: 1	Invasion of Egypt ::: Alliance with the Kingdom of Jerusalem	14	再者，曼努埃尔可能也想要去鼓励阿马尔里克的计划，不仅是为了让安条克从拉丁人的手中离开，而且加入这次军事冒险也可以建立了一个让耶路撒冷国王继续对曼努埃尔负债的新机会，这也将允许帝国去分享新取得的领土。	2 ::: 5 ::: 1	对外 ::: 远征埃及 ::: 与耶路撒冷王国的同盟	14
185	The joined forces of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169, but the siege was unsuccessful due to the failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully.	6 ::: 2	Invasion of Egypt ::: Failure of the expedition	0	1169年10月27日，拜占廷与十字军联军包围了杜姆亚特，但由于十字军和拜占廷军队合作的失败，这次围攻没能成功。	2 ::: 5 ::: 2	对外 ::: 远征埃及 ::: 远征的失败	0
185	According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, not wanting to share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders.	6 ::: 2	Invasion of Egypt ::: Failure of the expedition	1	拜占廷军队和阿马尔里克都不想分享胜利的成果，战事一直持续到拜占廷军队耗光粮食并且军中出现饥荒时；阿马尔里克对该城发动了一场突袭，但他立即又终止了行动转而与守城者寻求谈判。	2 ::: 5 ::: 2	对外 ::: 远征埃及 ::: 远征的失败	1

185	Despite the bad feelings generated at Damietta, Amalric still refused to abandon his dream of conquering Egypt, and he continued to seek good relations with the Byzantines in the hopes of another joined attack, which never took place.	6 ::: 2	Invasion of Egypt ::: Failure of the expedition	4	尽管杜姆亚特之围给了阿马尔里克不好的感受，但他仍然没有放弃夺取埃及的梦想，他继续寻求与拜占廷保持良好的关系并希望他们加入另一场进攻，但这从来没有实施过。	2 ::: 5 ::: 2	对外 ::: 远征埃及 ::: 远征的失败	4

185	Manuel was thus able to organise a grand ceremonial reception which both honoured Amalric and underlined his dependence: for the rest of Amalric's reign, Jerusalem was a Byzantine satellite, and Manuel was able to act as a protector of the Holy Places, exerting a growing influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.	6 ::: 2	Invasion of Egypt ::: Failure of the expedition	6	由此曼努埃尔得以为阿马尔里克安排一场令他获得荣誉的同时，彰显他对帝国的从属的盛大欢迎仪式：在阿马尔里克余下的统治时间里，耶路撒冷王国都是拜占廷的卫星国，曼努埃尔可以扮演圣地保护者的角色，向耶路撒冷王国施加越来越大的影响。	2 ::: 5 ::: 2	对外 ::: 远征埃及 ::: 远征的失败	6

185	Between 1158–1162, a series of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	0	1158年-1162年间拜占庭对罗姆苏丹发动的一系列战役使之达成了对拜占庭帝国十分有利的和约。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	0
185	According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	1	根据这份条约，包括西瓦斯在内的主要边境地区将由罗姆苏丹以部分金钱为交换转交于帝国手中，同时这也是为了迫使苏丹基利杰阿尔斯兰二世承认曼努埃尔的霸权。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	1
185	Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	2	后来当双方都不打算遵守这一条约的意图越发明显之时，基利杰阿尔斯兰二世随即达成协约将自己的势力扩展到了达尼什曼德。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	2

185	Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium in 1176.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	4	因此，1176年，他集结了整个拜占庭军队向罗姆苏丹首都科尼亚进军。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	4
185	Manuel's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	5	曼努埃尔的策略是以多利留姆与叟不莱昂作为进攻基地以尽可能快的攻下科尼亚。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	5
185	Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men was large and unwieldy – according to a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was ten miles  long.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	6	曼努埃尔的军队规模足足有三万五千人，这支军队庞大而又笨拙。 根据曼努埃尔写给英国国王亨利二世的信中所述，军队行军的队列长达10英里长。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	6

185	Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	8	就在通过密列奥塞法隆的入口之外，曼努埃尔接见了罗姆苏丹的使者，他们提出相当慷慨的条件向皇帝议和。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	8
185	The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	9	然而军中那些年轻好斗的皇室成员劝告曼努埃尔赶快进攻，曼努埃尔竟接受了他们的建议并继续进军。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	9
185	Manuel made serious tactical errors, such as failing to properly scout out the route ahead.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	10	曼努埃尔犯下了一些严重的战术失误，比如他没有派人前去侦察前方行军道路是否安全。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	10
185	These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	11	这些疏忽导致他直接将自己的大军带进敌人的伏击圈中。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	11
185	On 17 September 1176 Manuel was checked by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon , in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	12	1176年9月17日，曼努埃尔被基利杰阿尔斯兰二世决定性地在密列奥塞法隆击败，拜占庭军队在通过狭窄的山路时遭到了伏击。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	12
185	The Byzantines were hemmed in by the narrowness of the pass, this allowed the Seljuks to concentrate their attacks on part of the Byzantine army, especially the baggage and siege train, without the rest being able to intervene.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	13	拜占庭军队太过分散并且他们被敌人团团包围了起来，拜占庭军队的的攻城器械也被迅速摧毁。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	13
185	The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	14	之后曼努埃尔因为没有攻城器械而被迫撤退，攻占科尼亚的计划也成了泡影。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	14
185	According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both during and after the battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	15	曼努埃尔在战役发生时便已经失去了他的勇气，他的精神也在极端的自负与自贬中波动。 根据推尔的威廉记载，这是曼努埃尔唯一一次变得这样。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	15
185	The terms by which Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were that he should remove his forts and armies on the frontier at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	16	基利杰阿尔斯兰二世提出的议和条件是允许曼努埃尔和他的军队离开，但曼努埃尔需要拆除一些边境堡垒并将多利留姆与叟不莱昂边境上的的守军撤出。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	16
185	Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	17	然而，由于苏丹没能履行他在1162年承诺的约定，曼努埃尔只下令拆除了叟不莱昂的防御工事，而保留了多利留姆的。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	17
185	Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	18	但密列奥塞法隆战役的战败使得曼努埃尔及他的拜占庭帝国都陷入了难堪的窘境之中。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	18
185	The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	19	自从105年之前的曼齐克特战役后，科穆宁王朝的皇帝们一直勤奋努力着，就是为了恢复帝国以往在欧洲的声望。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	19
185	Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not decisively defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	20	然而由于曼努埃尔的过分自信，他向整个欧洲展示出拜占庭帝国仍然无法击败突厥人，尽管帝国在过去的一个世纪里已经有了很大的进步。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	20
185	In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	21	就曼努埃尔以拜占庭皇帝的身份而言，腓特烈一世以神圣罗马帝国皇帝的身份称曼努埃尔为希腊国王并要求向他臣服。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	21
185	The defeat at Myriokephalon has often been depicted as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	22	密列奥塞法隆战役常被描述为一场拜占庭军队全军覆灭的惨败。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	22
185	Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert; it seemed to him that the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	23	曼努埃尔自己也把这场战役与曼齐克特战役的惨败相提并论；在他看来，拜占庭倘若能在密列奥塞法隆战役获得胜利便能洗刷曼齐克特战役战败所受的耻辱。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	23
185	In reality, although a defeat, it was not too costly and did not significantly diminish the Byzantine army.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	24	事实上，尽管拜占庭帝国战败，但其军队的主要力量并没有被大幅削弱。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	24
185	Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing, largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch, and also by the baggage train, which was the main target of the Turkish ambush.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	25	因为绝大部分部队的伤亡都是右翼部队所遭受的，而他们主要是由安条克的鲍德温所指挥的附庸国部队所组成；同时还有大量的辎重车辆，因为他们是突厥人主要的攻击目标。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	25
185	The limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered, and in the following year Manuel's forces defeated a force of "picked Turks".	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	26	拜占庭军队有限的损失很快就恢复了，并且第二年帝国军队就击败了来犯的罗姆苏丹“精锐部队”。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	26
185	John Komnenos Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way. Vatatzes caught the Turks in an ambush as they were crossing the Meander River, the subsequent Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir effectively destroyed them as a fighting force.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	27	约翰·科穆宁·维塔斯被曼努埃尔命令去击败来犯的突厥部队，他不仅从首都君士坦丁堡带来了一支部队并一直集结沿途部队，这使得他在曼德尔河谷战役中大胜突厥军队。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	27
185	After the victory on the Meander, Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from Panasium, south of Cotyaeum.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	28	在取得胜利之后，曼努埃尔亲率一支小部队去驱赶从屈塔希亚以南的巴纳兹而来的突厥部队。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	28
185	In 1178, however, a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at Charax, allowing the Turks to capture many livestock.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	29	但在1178年，一支拜占庭部队在查拉克斯遭遇了一支突厥部队后便撤退，这让突厥人劫掠了许多牲畜。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	29
185	The continuous warfare had a serious effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	30	持续不断的战事严重削弱了曼努埃尔的活力；他的健康迅速恶化，最终在1180年因伤寒去世。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	30
185	Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift – Manuel never again attacked the Turks, and after his death they began to move further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.	7	Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks	31	此外，如同曼齐克特战役，拜占庭帝国与罗姆苏丹两大势力的平衡自此完全转变——曼努埃尔再也没能主动进攻罗姆苏丹，在他去世后突厥人开始越过边境攻取拜占庭帝国剩余的小亚细亚领土并进一步向西迁移。	2 ::: 6	对外 ::: 与罗姆苏丹的最后战斗	31

185	Ten years later, a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ, "My Father is greater than I", referred to his divine nature, to his human nature, or to the union of the two.	8	Doctrinal controversies (1156–1180)	3	十年后，又一场论战因基督所说的“我的父亲比我更伟大”而展开，这是属于他的神性，还是他的人性，又或是两者的联合？	3 ::: 1	对内 ::: 教义上的争论	3

185	Manuel, on the other hand, perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union, found that the formula made sense, and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue, where he had the support of the patriarch Luke Chrysoberges and later Patriarch Michael III.	8	Doctrinal controversies (1156–1180)	5	另一方面，曼努埃尔察觉到这或许是一个推动东西教会联合的一个契机，他找到了一个合情合理的方案，并在1166年3月2日所举办的宗教会议上得到了多数支持并将此问题解决了，在会议上他得到了君士坦丁堡普世宗主教Luke Chrysoberges和未来的宗主教Michael III of Constantinople的支持。	3 ::: 1	对内 ::: 教义上的争论	5

192	Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	6	他的实验室的结果证实了这一点，加强了他的信念。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	6
192	In 1848, he extended the Carnot–Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the gas thermometer provided only an operational definition of temperature.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	7	1848年，由于不满气体温度计只给出了温度的一个操作性的定义，他进一步扩大了卡诺-克拉伯龙的理论。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	7
192	He proposed an "absolute temperature scale" in which "a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature "T"° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature °, would give out the same mechanical effect "[work]", whatever be the number" T"."	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	8	他提出了一种“绝对温标”，其中“单位热量从在该温标下温度为 T° 的物体 A，转移到温度为 ° 的物体 B，将给出相同的机械作用，无论 T 是多少”。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	8
192	Such a scale would be "quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance."	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	9	这样的温标将“独立于任何特定物质的物理性质”。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	9
192	By employing such a "waterfall", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat  could be transferred, the point of "absolute zero" about which Guillaume Amontons had speculated in 1702.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	10	通过采用这样的“瀑布”，汤姆逊猜想，将达到一个点，在此处无法有进一步的热可以转移，也即1702年吉勞米·阿芒顿曾猜想过的绝对零度。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	10
192	Thomson used data published by Regnault to calibrate his scale against established measurements.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	11	汤姆森使用了勒尼奥发表的测量数据来校准他的换算刻度。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	11
192	In his publication, Thomson wrote:  ... The conversion of heat  into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered  — But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's "very remarkable discoveries".	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	12	在他的文章中，汤姆逊写道：  ...热转换成机械作用的过程，至今未被发现，很可能是不可能的  ——但是从一个注脚能看出，他援引焦耳很显着的发现，对热量的理论第一次产生了怀疑。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	12
192	Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	13	出人意料的是，汤姆逊没有把他的论文寄给焦耳，但是当焦耳稍后读到它时，他写信给汤姆森声称他的研究已经证明热可以转换为功，但他正在计划进一步的实验。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	13
192	Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	14	10月27日，汤姆森回信，透露道他正在计划自己的实验，并希望他们两人的观点能得到和解。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	14

192	However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	16	然而，在接下来的两年中，虽然汤姆逊没有进行新的实验，他越来越不满卡诺的理论，并开始相信焦耳。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	16

192	During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the second law of thermodynamics.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	19	在他重写的过程中，他似乎已经萌生出了一些初步的关于热力学第二定律的想法。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	19
192	In Carnot's theory, lost heat was "absolutely lost" but Thomson contended that it was ""lost to man" irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world".	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	20	在卡诺的理论中，热损失是完全的丢失，但汤姆森认为，这是“对人类而言无可挽回地失去了，但对物质世界而言并没有失去”。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	20

192	I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on – I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing "vis viva" which is converted into heat; and that although some "vis viva" may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be "precisely" compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	22	我相信，物质世界的趋势，是运动会变得扩散开来，整体来说浓缩的反向动作在逐渐发生——我相信，没有物理动作可以将从太阳发出的热量恢复如初，这个源泉也并不是取之不尽用之不竭的；还有，地球和其他行星的运动正在失去“活力”并转化为热能，虽然有些“活力”可以恢复，例如地球通过接收太阳的热量，或通过其他方式，但该损失无法“精确”补偿——我认为可能是在不充足地补偿。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	22
192	Compensation would require "a creative act or an act possessing similar power".	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	23	补偿将需要一个创世的行为或具有类似能力的行为。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	23
192	In final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared "the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius."	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	24	在最终出版，汤姆逊从一个激进的出发撤退，并宣布“热的动力的全部理论建立在…两个…命题上，分别归功于焦耳以及卡诺和克劳修斯”。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	24
192	Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:  It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	25	接着，汤姆逊给出了第二定律的一种陈述形式：  由无生命物质的机构的手段，试图将物体的温度冷却到它周围环境中最冷温度之下，以获得从物质的任何部分的机械作用，是不可能的。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	25
192	In the paper, Thomson supported the theory that heat was a form of motion but admitted that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir Humphry Davy and the experiments of Joule and Julius Robert von Mayer, maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	26	在这篇论文中，汤姆逊支持“热是运动的一种形式”的理论，但也承认他只是受汉弗里·戴维爵士的想法和焦耳和尤利乌斯·冯·迈尔的实验的启发而有所感想，关于热可以转换为功的实验证明仍然悬而未决。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	26
192	As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	27	焦耳读到该文之后，立刻写信给汤姆逊，表达了他的意见和问题。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	27
192	Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	28	自此开始了两人之间一段卓有成效的协作：焦耳进行实验，汤姆逊分析结果并提出进一步的实验。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	28
192	The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, sometimes called the Kelvin–Joule effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	29	该合作历时1852年至1856年，其成果便是焦耳-汤姆逊效应，有时也被称为开尔文-焦耳效应，而且发表的结果在让焦耳的研究和分子运动论得到普遍接受上起了很大作用。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	29
192	Thomson published more than 650 scientific papers and applied for 70 patents .	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	30	汤姆逊发表了超过650篇科学论文，并申请了70项专利。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	30
192	Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:  In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	31	关于科学，汤姆逊写了以下这段话：  在物理科学中学习任何科目的方向的第一个重要步骤，就是找到数值推算和可行的方法测量一些质量与它相连的原则。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	31
192	I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of "science", whatever the matter may be.	1 ::: 4	Early life and work ::: Thermodynamics	32	我常说，当你能测量你所说的事物并以数字表达它时，说明关于这个事物你的确是知道一些的，但是当你无法测量它、无法以数字表达它时，说明你的所知就是贫乏的、难以令人满意的：它可能是知识的开端，但你几乎没有从思想上达到科学的阶段，无论这个事物是什么。	1 ::: 4	生平 ::: 热力学	32
192	Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	0	虽然在学术领域已经是名声显赫，汤姆森尚未被广大公众所知。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	0
192	In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum; but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	1	1852年9月，他娶了沃尔特·克拉姆的女儿，青梅竹马的玛格丽特·克拉姆，但在他们度蜜月时她的身体垮了，并在接下来的17年里，汤姆森一直在分心担忧她的病疾。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	1
192	On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	2	1854年10月16日，乔治·加布里埃尔·斯托克斯写信给汤姆森试图让他重新对工作提起兴趣，问他对拟议跨大西洋电报电缆之事和迈克尔·法拉第的一些相关实验的看法。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	2
192	Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent – in modern terms, the bandwidth.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	3	法拉第曾演示了电缆的建造方式将限制消息发送的速度。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	3
192	Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	4	汤姆森抓住了这个问题，并且在当月发表了他的回应，不仅预测了可以实现的数据传输速率，而且还评估了跨大西洋计划的潜在收益和经济效益。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	4
192	In a further 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	5	在1855年进一步的分析中汤姆森强调，电缆的设计将对其收益性有很大影响。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	5
192	Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	6	汤姆森认为，信号通过缆线的速度与芯部的长度的平方成反比。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	6
192	Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	7	该结果在1856年英国协会会议上被大西洋电报公司的电气工程师怀尔德曼·怀特豪斯驳斥。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	7
192	Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	8	怀特豪斯可能曲解了他自己的实验结果，但无疑是感到财政上的压力，因为电缆计划已经有条不紊地进行。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	8
192	He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be "abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible".	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	9	他认为，汤姆森的计算暗示电缆必须“被抛弃，因为实用上和商业上都不现实”。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	9
192	Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular "Athenaeum" magazine, pitching himself into the public eye.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	10	汤姆森在与著名杂志《Athenaeum》的通信中批判了怀特豪斯的论点，使得自己进入公众视线。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	10
192	Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	11	汤姆森推荐一个较大的导体与绝缘的更大的横截面。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	11
192	He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	12	不过，他认为怀特豪斯不是傻瓜，并觉得他可能有足够的实践技能，实现现有的设计。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	12
192	Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.	2 ::: 1	Transatlantic cable ::: Calculations on data rate	13	然而，汤姆森的研究已经吸引了项目的承担者的眼球；在1856年12月，他当选为大西洋电报公司的董事会成员。	2 ::: 1	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 数据速率的计算	13
192	Thomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir Charles Tilston Bright as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the specification, supported by Faraday and Samuel F. B. Morse.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	0	汤姆森成为了团队的科学顾问，怀特豪斯担任首席电工，查尔斯·蒂尔斯顿·布莱特爵士担任首席工程师。 但怀特豪斯在設計規格上有他的想法，法拉第和莫尔斯也支持他。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	0
192	Thomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship  in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after  when the cable parted.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	1	1857年8月，汤姆森登上了电缆敷设船HMS Agamemnon ，开始航行，怀特豪斯则因病留在岸上，但航行一段时间后电缆不幸断开了。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	1
192	Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the "Engineer" the whole theory of the stresses involved in the laying of a submarine cable, and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	2	对此，汤姆森在《Engineer》发表了铺设海底电缆所涉及到的应力的完整理论，并表明，当缆线以恒定的速度离开船体，进入到深度均匀的水中时，它会保持倾斜的直线的形状下沉，该直线从入水点延伸到触及底部的点。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	2
192	Thomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a character every 3.5 seconds.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	3	汤姆森开发了一个完整操作海底电报的系统，能够每3.5秒发送一个字母。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	3
192	He patented the key elements of his system, the mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder, in 1858.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	4	1858年，他给他的系统中的关键部分，也即反射镜检流计和虹吸记录器，申请了专利。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	4

192	It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	6	直到汤姆森说服董事会，使用更加纯净的铜更换电缆的丢失部分，以改善数据输送能力，汤姆森才第一次对项目的执行产生了影响。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	6
192	The board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	7	董事会坚持让汤姆森加入1858年的电缆敷设远征，没有任何经济补偿，并在项目中的积极参与。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	7
192	In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	8	作为回报，汤姆森获得了试验他的反射镜检流计的机会，对此董事会不甚感兴趣，怀特豪斯旁边的装备。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	8
192	Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the "Agamemnon" had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	9	然而，在1858年6月的灾难性风暴之后，阿伽门农号只好打道回府。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	9
192	In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	10	回到伦敦后，董事会几乎要放弃该项目，并打算通过销售电缆减轻其损失的程度。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	10
192	Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	11	汤姆森、赛勒斯·韦斯特·菲尔德和柯蒂斯·米兰达·兰普森说服了董事会再尝试一次，汤姆森坚持认为技术问题是容易处理的。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	11
192	Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work.	2 ::: 2	Transatlantic cable ::: Scientist to Engineer	12	虽然仅以顾问的身份参与，汤姆森已经在航行中获得了在压力下解决实际问题的真正的工程师的直觉和技能，往往率先在处理突发事件，并且不畏惧对体力活伸出援助之手。	2 ::: 2	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 从科学家到工程师	12

192	Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems.	2 ::: 3	Transatlantic cable ::: Disaster and triumph	1	但怀特豪斯坚持认为，是他的装置提供了服务，并开始涉足绝望的措施来做出一些补救。	2 ::: 3	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 灾难和胜利	1
192	He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000 V. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference.	2 ::: 3	Transatlantic cable ::: Disaster and triumph	2	结果，他只是成功地用 2,000 V 的电压彻底损坏了电缆。 当电缆完全失败，怀特豪斯被开除；汤姆森表示反对，还被董事会谴责他的干扰。	2 ::: 3	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 灾难和胜利	2
192	Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigor.	2 ::: 3	Transatlantic cable ::: Disaster and triumph	3	这之后汤姆森感到后悔，他太随便地默许了许多怀特豪斯的提议，并没有花足够的力气去质疑他。	2 ::: 3	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 灾难和胜利	3
192	A joint committee of inquiry was established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.	2 ::: 3	Transatlantic cable ::: Disaster and triumph	4	贸易委员会和大西洋电报公司联合设立了调查委员会，发现关于电缆的故障，怀特豪斯应当承担大多数的责任。	2 ::: 3	跨大西洋电报电缆 ::: 灾难和胜利	4

Michelson, who in 1894 stated: "… it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established … An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals."	5 ::: 2	Aftermath and legacy ::: Pronouncements later proven to be false	8	没有任何证据表明开尔文说了这段话；这段话其实是根据阿尔伯特·迈克耳孙所说的话改编的，他在1894年中指出：“……似乎可以说，物理学宏大的基本原则已经牢固确立……一个着名的物理学家说，未来物理科学的真理应当从六位小数中寻找。”	5 ::: 2	身后影响和遗产 ::: 后来被证明是错的论断	8

196	They recorded one album, which was shelved by Epic Records, and played a handful of live shows.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	1	這支樂團進行過少量的現場演出，並錄製了一張專輯，但是並沒有發行，樂團也沒獲得什麼成就。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	1
196	Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	2	因此保羅·史丹利和吉恩·西蒙斯認為需要改進音樂方向，在1972年解散邪神萊斯特，計劃重新組建新的樂團。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	2
196	In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the East Coast version of "Rolling Stone" placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and Chelsea. Simmons and Stanley met him in a nightclub where he was playing drums.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	3	1972年底，保羅·史丹利和吉恩·西蒙斯在美國著名的《滾石雜誌》上看到了一則紐約資深鼓手彼得·克里斯刊登的廣告，因此保羅·史丹利和吉恩·西蒙斯前往他打鼓的夜總會。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	3
196	After hearing Criss sing, they thought of him being in the band.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	4	在聽完彼得·克里斯唱歌後，他們想將他招進樂團裡。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	4

196	The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. They also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	6	樂團的目標是演奏比邪神萊斯特難度更高的搖滾樂風格，他們還開始嘗試透過化妝和各種服裝來樹立形象。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	6

196	In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist Ace Frehley.

196	A few weeks after Frehley joined, Wicked Lester changed their name to Kiss. Stanley came up with the name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss mentioned that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of "What about Kiss?"	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	10	幾週後，有一次吉恩·西蒙斯和彼得·克里斯在紐約市區開車，克里斯提到他曾經在一個名為嘴脣的樂團裡，所以保羅·史丹利提議說「接吻這個名字如何？」，於是正式命名為接吻樂團。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	10
196	Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the "SS" look like lightning bolts.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	11	艾斯·弗利設計了沿用至今的樂團標誌，使得「SS」看起來像閃電一樣。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	11
196	Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it "by eye."	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	12	後來保羅·史丹利以手繪的方式畫出了樂團標誌，他並沒有利用尺規，結果「SS」的形狀並沒有完全吻合。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	12
196	The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, "It got us this far, let's leave well enough alone. Our number one rule has always been no rules."	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	13	後來藝術部門問他是否希望重新繪製樂團標誌，讓圖案更完美，他說：「我們的規則就是沒有規則，也因此才能讓我們走這麼遠」。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	13
196	Since 1979, most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany have used an alternate logo, in which the letters "SS" look like the letters "ZZ" backwards. This logo is also used in Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Lithuania, Hungary and Israel to avoid controversy.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	14	但是在德國，由於樂團標誌被認定類似納粹黨衛隊的標誌，違反了《德國刑法第86條》，因此自1979年以來，接吻樂團在德國發行的唱片以及周邊產品都是另一種形狀，在奧地利、瑞士、波蘭、立陶宛、匈牙利和以色列中也使用變體後的標誌以避免爭議。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	14
196	The band's name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are claims that the name is an acronym for "Knights in Satan's Service", "Kinder SS", or "Kids in Satan's Service". Simmons has denied all of these claims.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	15	樂團的名字也被外界指控有邪惡意涵，「KISS」被解讀為「效忠撒旦的騎士」、「黨衛隊的孩子」和「效忠撒旦的孩子」的縮寫，吉恩·西蒙斯否認了所有這些說法。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	15

196	Simmons responded, "You should only know", to which Fields replied, "I do. You can't hide the hook", a reference to the stereotypical "Jewish" nose.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	29	吉恩·西蒙斯問：「你怎麼知道？」，托蒂·菲爾茲回答說：「我確實知道，你藏不了鷹鉤鼻」。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	29

196	The band  stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording their second album, "Hotter Than Hell," which was released on October 22, 1974.

196	With "Hotter Than Hell" quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from their tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of "Hotter Than Hell" for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	33	隨著《炙熱閻獄》在排行榜上的位置迅速下滑，樂團在巡迴演出中途抽空錄製了一張新專輯，因經費不足，由卡薩布蘭卡唱片的負責人尼爾·博格特擔任製作人，他捨棄《炙熱閻獄》中吵嘈失真的音色，改為追求更乾淨、更澎湃的表現。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	33

196	Although Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for their live performances.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	35	雖然在當時前三張專輯沒有大賣，但是他們卻很快在現場表演中贏得了聲譽，在搖滾界有了一席之地。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	35
196	Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting "blood"  and "breathing fire" , Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames , Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley's Townshend-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	36	接吻樂團的現場演出很受歡迎，他們在大大小小的演出中都表演著自己的特技，如吉恩·西蒙斯的「吐血」、「口中噴火」；艾斯·弗利的吉他獨奏以及他在獨奏時的「吉他冒煙特效」；彼得·克里斯的「升降鼓座」、「放射火花」；保羅·史丹利的「砸吉他」、「飛行吉他」，還有現場的爆破煙火，這些都成為接吻樂團的招牌特色。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	36
196	By mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing their record contract.	1 ::: 1	History ::: 1971–1975: Early years	37	由於唱片銷量的不理想，到1975年中期，卡薩布蘭卡唱片面臨幾乎破產的難關，而接吻樂團也有可能失去合約、拿不到下次錄音的資金。	1 ::: 1	歷史 ::: 成立初期（1971－1975年）	37

196	For their next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on "Destroyer".

196	However, 1981's "Music from "The Elder"" was a concept album featuring medieval horns, strings, harps, and synthesizers.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	26	1981年發行第九張錄音室專輯《昔日的音樂》，這張專輯很有藝術性，是一個以中世紀號角、豎琴和合成器為特色的概念專輯。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	26

196	Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	36	艾斯·弗利的另一個失望之處在於彼得·克里斯的離開，接任的艾瑞克·卡爾沒有決策權、也不是樂團中地位平等的夥伴，所以艾斯·弗利的意見經常被樂團內部2對1投票否決。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	36

196	Soon after, Kiss made major changes to their business dealings – chief among them was severing ties with their manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on their unwieldy organizational tree.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	42	不久之後，接吻樂團對他們的商業交易做出了重大改變，其中最主要的原因是與合作九年的經紀人比爾·艾考斷絕關係，並削減了他們繁雜的組織架構。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	42
196	Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's "Killers" and "Creatures of the Night", although he did not participate in the recording of either album.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	43	儘管艾斯·弗利已經離開樂團、也沒有參與錄音製作，但他的肖像仍出現在1982年精選輯《殺手 》和錄音室專輯《暗夜生物》的封面上。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	43

196	The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the "Creatures of the Night" album.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	49	重新混音的《暗夜生物》將艾斯·弗利與維尼爾·文森並列為樂團的吉他手。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	49

196	According to the official authorized Kiss biography, written by David Leaf and Ken Sharp, "The Egyptian Ankh Warrior" refers to Vincent's make-up and persona, while the nickname "The Wiz" refers to his virtuosity as a guitar player.	1 ::: 4	History ::: 1979–1983: Final make-up years	58	根據官方授權的接吻樂團傳記，作者大衛·利夫和肯·沙普寫的「埃及安卡勇士」是指文森的裝扮和角色，而綽號「巫師」是指他身為吉他手的高超琴藝。	1 ::: 4	歷史 ::: 成員輪替（1979－1983年）	58
196	According to the Simmons autobiography "Kiss and Make-Up", Vincent's Kiss persona was solely "The Wiz".

196	Their music is described as "a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late 1980s."	2	Musical style	6	他們的音樂被描述為「在商業性上有力的融合了流行歌曲，拳頭猛擊般的硬式搖滾，由響亮吉他、甜膩旋律、清晰弦樂、動人的流行記憶點和抒情歌組成，這是一種招牌音色，為體育場搖滾和具有流行特色的金屬樂奠定了基礎，並在80年代後期主導了搖滾樂發展」。	2	音樂風格	6

196	At the same time, Bennington Banner from "Rock Music" magazine said, "With its members' bizarre, Kabuki-like makeup, studded black leather costumes and arsenal of on-stage firepower – both musical and literal – Kiss represents the most extreme form of hard rock in 1974."	2	Musical style	9	與此同時，《搖滾音樂》雜誌的班寧頓·布朗說：「由於其成員的詭異、如同歌舞伎般的妝容，鑲滿鉚釘的黑皮衣和致命的舞台火力——無論是音樂還是文字——接吻樂團在1974年代表了最極端的搖滾樂」。	2	音樂風格	9

196	"We had to go through torture to perfect the process of putting it on," Stanley admitted in 1996. "I can remember plenty of times when I blinded myself with black eye make-up ... In the beginning, the white was a zinc oxide cream which you can buy in any pharmacy.  We didn't know what we were doing; we just wanted white faces ... and the zinc oxide beating spraying ourselves with white paint.  We eventually worked our way up to what's called 'clown white.’  The two best brands are made by Stein's and Max Factor ... At first, the black was Maybelline waterproof eyeliner, but it would crack because it's only meant to draw a line around your eye, not a whole star.  Now we use black grease sticks, which are a more solid form of greasepaint.  The silver that Peter and Ace use is made by Stein's, and it comes in bottles in either metallic gold or metallic silver …  The only time we have problems is in situations of extreme heat.  I remember doing a show when it was so hot and humid that the make-up literally ran off our faces. Between songs we'd run to the side of the stage to slap on more clown white!”	5	Make-up designs	0	保羅·史丹利在1996年承認：「我們總要歷經一番折磨才能完美的將招牌妝畫到臉上。我被黑色眼妝弄瞎好幾次，我記得發生了好多次......一開始，白色顏料是用可以在隨便一家藥房買到的氧化鋅乳霜，當時我們不知道自己在幹麻，只是想把整張臉塗成白色，所以就把超多的氧化鋅拍打塗抹在臉上，最後我們按照自己的方式，研發出專屬的『小丑白』。Stein's和蜜絲佛陀製造的最好用。......一開始，黑色是用媚比琳防水眼線筆畫的，但它會龜裂，因為它只能用來在眼睛周圍劃線，想畫成一個大星星就不行了，現在我們改用黑色的油脂棒，這是一種更持久的顏料，彼得·克里斯和艾斯·弗利塗的銀色是Stein's製造的，而且它還有金屬金或金屬銀......有一次氣溫太高，導致我們出了問題，我記得那次表演的現場超級熱、超級潮濕，臉妝就像下雨似的奔流，我們只能趁在歌曲之間的空檔，跑到舞台旁邊抹上更多的小丑白！」	4	招牌妝容設計	0

214	Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians.	4	First term as governor	6	肯塔基州曾与俄亥俄河以北的美洲原住民不宣而战，但战争部长亨利·诺克斯却命令谢尔比不要针对印第安人发起进攻性的军事行动。	3	第一个州长任期	6
214	Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective.	4	First term as governor	7	此外由于联邦法规的限制，州民兵的服役期限只有30天，这样的时间实在太短，难以保障军队的战斗力。	3	第一个州长任期	7
214	With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack.	4	First term as governor	8	新成立的州羽翼未丰、资源匮乏，导致谢尔比只能保护那些最脆弱的地区免受印第安人袭击。	3	第一个州长任期	8
214	Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.	4	First term as governor	9	与此同时，肯塔基州居民还怀疑印第安人受到英国人的资助和煽动。	3	第一个州长任期	9
214	Shelby appealed to President Washington for help; Washington responded by appointing General "Mad" Anthony Wayne to the area with orders to push the Indians out of the Northwest Territory.	4	First term as governor	10	谢尔比向总统华盛顿求助，华盛顿于是派有“疯狂的安东尼”之称的安东尼·韦恩将军前去将印第安人赶出西北领地。	3	第一个州长任期	10
214	Wayne arrived at Fort Washington  in May 1793, but was prevented from taking any immediate action because federal commissioners were still attempting to negotiate a treaty with the Indians.	4	First term as governor	11	韦恩于1793年5月抵达华盛顿堡，但由于联邦特派员仍在试图与印第安人通过谈判达成协定而无法立即采取行动。	3	第一个州长任期	11
214	He called for 1,000 volunteer troops from Kentucky, but few heeded the call and Shelby resorted to conscription.	4	First term as governor	12	他呼吁肯塔基州派出1000人的志愿军，但响应者寥寥无几，谢尔比于是诉诸征兵。	3	第一个州长任期	12
214	By the time the soldiers arrived, winter had set in.  He ordered the men to go home and return in the spring.	4	First term as governor	13	但等到军队集结到足够人数时已是冬天，于是韦恩又只好下令所有军人先回家过冬，等到春季再返回。	3	第一个州长任期	13
214	After a winter filled with Indian attacks, including one which claimed the life of Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794.	4	First term as governor	14	印第安人在这个冬季发动了大量袭击，谢尔比的弟弟埃文·谢尔比三世也因此丧生。1794年初，肯塔基州民兵部队在同印第安人的战争中获得了一些小规模胜利。	3	第一个州长任期	14
214	In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained.	4	First term as governor	15	春季，面对韦恩的号召，部队士气高涨，1600名志愿军集结达克县格林维尔堡仓促受训。	3	第一个州长任期	15
214	By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers.	4	First term as governor	16	到了1794年8月，韦恩已向印第安人展开进攻，并在这个月20号的鹿寨战役中取得决定性的胜利。	3	第一个州长任期	16
214	This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby did not agree with some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.	4	First term as governor	17	这场胜利和随后签订的格林维尔条约使西北领地得到稳固，谢尔比对条约中一些针对西部定居者的限制有不同看法，但他还是恪守了这些条款，并在自己管辖范围内遵照执行。	3	第一个州长任期	17
214	Another major concern of the Shelby administration was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests.	4	First term as governor	18	谢尔比政府的另一个主要关注点是密西西比河的自由通航，这对肯塔基州经济有至关重要的作用。	3	第一个州长任期	18
214	For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans.	4	First term as governor	19	西班牙人之前因政治方面原因令新奥尔良港口停止向美国人开放。	3	第一个州长任期	19
214	This would have been the natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments.	4	First term as governor	20	这里一直以来都是肯塔基州农民生产的烟草、面粉和汉麻的天然市场，如果走陆路则会导致成本过高，无利可图，土地投机商也难以吸引移民前来以期收回投资。	3	第一个州长任期	20
214	Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.	4	First term as governor	21	许多肯塔基人觉得联邦政府在改善这种情况上没有采取果断行动，或是行动的效率太低。	3	第一个州长任期	21
214	While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, they had a strong affinity for the French.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	0	正当肯塔基人对英国人和西班牙人都没有好感之际，他们对法国人却很有亲切感。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	0
214	They admired the republican government that had arisen from the French Revolution, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the Revolutionary War.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	1	他们钦佩在法国大革命中兴起的共和政府，而且也记得革命战争期间法国提供的援助。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	1
214	When French Ambassador Edmond-Charles Genêt, popularly known as Citizen Genêt, arrived in the United States in April 1793, George Rogers Clark was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	2	1793年4月，法国大使埃德蒙·查尔斯·热内到达美国，乔治·罗杰斯·克拉克这时已经在考虑发动远征，夺取西班牙在西部的领地。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	2
214	Genêt's agent, André Michaux, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	3	热内派安德烈·米修前往肯塔基州，评估当地居民对克拉克发动远征的支持程度。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	3
214	When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Kentucky Senator John Brown.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	4	凭着国务卿托马斯·杰弗逊和肯塔基州联邦参议员约翰·布朗的介绍信，他见到了州长谢尔比。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	4
214	Jefferson had written a separate letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	5	杰弗逊另写了一封信给谢尔比，警告他不要答应对法国提供援助，并称与西班牙已就密西西比河贸易问题展开谈判。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	5
214	When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	6	这封信于1793年8月29日发出，杰弗逊本期望信能在米修到达前送到谢尔比手中，但州长却迟至1793年10月才收到这封信。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	6
214	On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, but there is no evidence that Shelby agreed to help him.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	7	米修和谢尔比于1793年9月13日会面，但没有任何证据表明州长有同意提供帮助。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	7
214	In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians "possess too just a sense of the obligation they owe the General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States".	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	8	对于迟来的信件，谢尔比向杰弗逊保证，肯塔基人“具有一种亏欠中央政府的责任感”，所以不会做出任何对美国有损的事。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	8
214	In November 1793, Shelby received a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	9	1793年11月，谢尔比收到热内另一名手下查尔斯·德尔泼的来信。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	9
214	He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	10	他向谢尔比吐露，自己曾获派确保针对西班牙人的远征军的补给安全，并询问谢尔比是否已接到指示，逮捕与此计划有关联的个人。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	10
214	Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	11	谢尔比于三天后回了信，其中提及了杰弗逊有关不要协助法国的警告。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	11
214	Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	12	虽然没有任何证据表明谢尔比参与了热内的计划，但杰弗逊和诺克斯都觉得有必要再次提醒他不要协助法国。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	12
214	Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	13	杰弗逊还提供了据悉身在肯塔基州的法国间谍名单和相貌描述，并指出可以把这些人逮捕。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	13
214	Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	14	诺克斯的提议更进一步，称肯塔基州如果遇到法国人的抵抗而有必要动用武力，则因此产生的任何开销都将会得到补偿。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	14
214	General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	15	安东尼·韦恩将军告知谢尔比，自己的骑兵任归调遣。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	15
214	Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	16	美国西北领地总督阿瑟·圣克莱尔也告诫谢尔比不要和热内合作。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	16
214	In his response to Jefferson, Shelby questioned whether he had the legal authority to intervene with force against his constituency and expressed his personal aversion to doing so.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	17	谢尔比在给杰弗逊的回复中质疑自己是否有合法权力来以武力干预他选区人民的选择，同时也表达自己对这一行径的反感。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	17
214	I shall upon all occasions be averse to the exercise of any power which I do not consider myself as being clearly and explicitly invested with, much less would I assume power to exercise it against men whom I consider as friends and brethren, in favor of a man whom I view as an enemy and a tyrant [the king of Spain].	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	18	在任何情况下，我都不愿意行使那些自认为没有清楚而明确授予我的权力，更不用说还要为了讨好一个我视为敌人和暴君的人，而用这种权力去对付那些我眼中的朋友和弟兄。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	18
214	I shall also feel but little inclination to take an active part in punishing or restraining any of my fellow-citizens for a supposed intention only to gratify or remove the fears of the ministers of a foreign prince, who openly withholds from us an invaluable right [navigation of the Mississippi] and who secretly instigates against us a most savage and cruel enemy.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	19	我也不大愿意对自己的任何同胞加以惩罚和限制，因为他们做的不过是表明意向，消除自己心中的对外国势力的恐惧，这个国家曾公然扣除我们最宝贵的权利，还在暗中煸动最野蛮、最残酷的敌人来对付我们。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	19
214	Shelby tempered this lukewarm commitment by assuring Jefferson that "I shall, at all times, hold it my duty to perform whatever may be constitutionally required of me, as Governor of Kentucky, by the President of the United States."	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	20	最后，谢尔比用这样一句不冷不热的话向杰弗逊承诺：“我会在任何时候履行宪法中要求我做为肯塔基州州长应该履行的义务，遵守美利坚合众国总统的指令。”	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	20
214	In March 1794, perhaps in response to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers in the event of an invasion or insurrection.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	21	1794年3月，联邦国会授权联邦政府在遭遇入侵或叛乱的情况下拥有更多的权力，这一举措有可能正是因谢尔比的回复而起。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	21
214	Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	22	实际收到他回信的是杰弗逊的继任者埃德蒙·伦道夫，他写信告诉谢尔比自己拥有的新权力，还告诉他法国的政权已经变天，并且命令热内回国。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	22
214	Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	23	两个月后，热内的手下停止在肯塔基州进行宣传，一场潜伏的危机也得以避免。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	23
214	In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	24	1795年，华盛顿总统同西班牙达成协助，确保了美国人通过密西西比河进行贸易活动的权利。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	24
214	Having successfully dealt with the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	25	谢尔比在第一个州长任期内成功处理了组建新州政府所面临的主要挑战，肯塔基州的安全得到保障，财务状况也很正常。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	25
214	Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, at the conclusion of his term in 1796.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	26	由于肯塔基州宪法禁止州长连任，所以谢尔比在1796年卸任后回到了林肯县的故居。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	26
214	For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.	4 ::: 1	First term as governor ::: Citizen Genêt affair	27	接下来的15年时间里，他专心务农，并连续6次成为总统选举人，不过除此以外，他都没有出现在公众视野中。	3 ::: 1	第一个州长任期 ::: 热内事件	27

214	Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war.	5	Second term as governor	1	这时美国、法国和大英帝国的关系日益紧张，随时有可能爆发战争。	4	第二个州长任期	1
214	With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor.	5	Second term as governor	2	考虑到这样的局势，开始有流言称艾萨克·谢尔比有可能成为州长候选人。	4	第二个州长任期	2
214	Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run.	5	Second term as governor	3	斯劳特的家离谢尔比很近，他亲自登门拜访，询问老州长是否会参选。	4	第二个州长任期	3
214	Shelby assured him that he had no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged.	5	Second term as governor	4	谢尔比向他承诺，除非出现国家紧急情况并且需要他的领导，否则自己无意参选。	4	第二个州长任期	4
214	Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.	5	Second term as governor	5	斯劳特听后大感放心并随即开始了竞选。	4	第二个州长任期	5
214	The situation with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the War of 1812.	5	Second term as governor	6	美国与欧洲列强的关系恶化，1812年，美国向大英帝国宣战，拉开了1812年战争的序幕。	4	第二个州长任期	6
214	Cries grew louder for Shelby to return as Kentucky's chief executive.	5	Second term as governor	7	要求谢尔比回归肯塔基州行政长官一职的呼声日益高涨。	4	第二个州长任期	7
214	On July 18, 1812, less than a month before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced his candidacy.	5	Second term as governor	8	1812年7月18日，距选举还有不到一个月时，谢尔比宣布参选。	4	第二个州长任期	8
214	During the campaign Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized his response to Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States.	5	Second term as governor	9	竞选期间，以汉弗莱·马歇尔为代表的谢尔比政敌批评老州长对杰弗逊有关热内事件第二封信的回复，质疑他是否忠于合众国。	4	第二个州长任期	9
214	Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention to the situation in the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked.	5	Second term as governor	10	谢尔比称，自己当年的回复是为了引起联邦政府对西部局势的注意，并援引华盛顿和西班牙所达成的协议作为自己计策成功的证据。	4	第二个州长任期	10
214	He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.	5	Second term as governor	11	他还表示，自己在写信的时候已经知道，法国的计划注定要失败。	4	第二个州长任期	11
214	Slaughter's supporters mocked Shelby's advanced age , calling him "Old Daddy Shelby".	5	Second term as governor	12	斯劳特的支持者嘲笑谢尔比年势已高，称他是“老爸谢尔比”。	4	第二个州长任期	12
214	One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous charge that Shelby had run from the Battle of King's Mountain.	5	Second term as governor	13	州内有家报纸甚至刊文指控谢尔比曾在王山之战中逃跑。	4	第二个州长任期	13
214	Though few even among Shelby's enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself responded through missives in the state's newspapers.	5	Second term as governor	14	虽然即便是谢尔比政敌中相信这一说法的也寥寥无几，但他还是和支持者在州内多家报纸上发布公文予以回应。	4	第二个州长任期	14
214	One supporter typified these responses, writing "It is reported that Colonel Shelby 'run [sic] at King's Mountain.’ True he did. He first run [sic] up to the enemy ... then after an action of about forty-seven minutes, he run [sic] again with 900 prisoners."	5	Second term as governor	15	其中一位代表性的支持者写道：“据悉，谢尔比上校‘在王山之战中跑了’。是的，他是跑了，他首先跑向敌军……经过大约47分钟后，他又带着900名战俘跑回来了。”	4	第二个州长任期	15
214	As the canvass stretched into August, Shelby grew more confident of victory and began preparations to return to the state house.	5	Second term as governor	16	竞选进入8月后，谢尔比对获胜有了更大的信心，并开始准备第二次担任州长。	4	第二个州长任期	16
214	He predicted a victory of 10,000 votes; the final margin was more than 17,000.	5	Second term as governor	17	他预计自己会以1万票优势取胜，但最终他的票比对方要多1.7万余票。	4	第二个州长任期	17
214	When he took the oath of office, Shelby became the first Kentucky governor to serve non-consecutive terms.	5	Second term as governor	18	这样，谢尔比也就成为肯塔基州历史上第一位没有连任但却当了两任州长的政治家，詹姆斯·加勒德得以通过特别立法豁免而在1796和1800年当选州长，但他的任期是连续进行的。	4	第二个州长任期	18

214	This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian.	5	Second term as governor	21	这一任命实际上违反了州宪法有关这一职位只能由肯塔基州人担任的规定。	4	第二个州长任期	21
214	Already commander of the militias of Indiana and Illinois, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying to the defense of Fort Wayne.	5	Second term as governor	22	哈里森这时已是印第安纳州和伊利诺伊州的民兵指挥官，他在纽波特挑选了肯塔基州志愿军，然后赶去防御韦恩堡。	4	第二个州长任期	22
214	Shelby pressured President James Madison to give Harrison command of all military forces in the Northwest. Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier appointment of James Winchester.	5	Second term as governor	23	谢尔比努力说服总统詹姆斯·麦迪逊，让哈里森拥有西北领地所有军队的指挥权，原本已经任命詹姆斯·温彻斯特的麦迪逊同意了他的建议。	4	第二个州长任期	23
214	On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male between the ages of 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers were excluded from the provision.	5	Second term as governor	24	谢尔比又修订了州民兵的法律，规定州内所有18至45岁男性都需服兵役，只有政府官员可以排除在外。	4	第二个州长任期	24
214	Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away.	5	Second term as governor	25	最终肯塔基州招募了7000名志愿军，更多的人只能拒之门外。	4	第二个州长任期	25

214	Shelby's confidence in the federal government's war planning was shaken by the disastrous Battle of Frenchtown in which a number of Kentucky soldiers died.	5	Second term as governor	27	谢尔比原本对联邦政府的战争计划充满信心，但在灾难性的弗伦奇敦战役后，他的信心动摇了，这场战斗中有410名美军将士阵亡，其中许多都是肯塔基军人。	4	第二个州长任期	27
214	He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so.	5	Second term as governor	28	他发誓要在时机出现时亲自采取行动，为战事努力，并随即得到了州议会的授权。	4	第二个州长任期	28
214	In March 1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at Fort Meigs. Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest son James, under General Green Clay.	5	Second term as governor	29	1813年3月，哈里森号召另外1200名肯塔基人到梅格斯要塞同自己会合，谢尔比派出相应数字的军人前往，自己的长子詹姆斯也在其中，由格林·克莱将军指挥。	4	第二个州长任期	29
214	The reinforcements arrived to find Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians.	5	Second term as governor	30	援兵赶到目的地时，却发现要塞正遭到英军和印第安人的围困。	4	第二个州长任期	30
214	Clay's force was able to stop the siege, but a large number of them were captured and massacred by Indians.	5	Second term as governor	31	克莱的兵力成功阻止了围攻，但其中有许多人都遭印第安人俘获并屠杀。	4	第二个州长任期	31
214	Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner exchange.	5	Second term as governor	32	起初的报告中称詹姆斯·谢尔比也已阵亡，但之后发现他只是被俘，并通过战俘交换得以返回。	4	第二个州长任期	32
214	On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby requesting volunteers, and this time he asked that Shelby lead them personally.	5	Second term as governor	33	1813年7月30日，哈里森将军再次给谢尔比写信请求派志愿军前来支援，并且还请谢尔比亲自带兵。	4	第二个州长任期	33
214	Shelby raised a force of 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested.	5	Second term as governor	34	谢尔比于是统领3500名志愿军前往，兵力是哈里森要求数字的两倍。	4	第二个州长任期	34
214	Future governor John J. Crittenden served as Shelby's aide-de-camp.	5	Second term as governor	35	之后将成为州长的约翰·J·克里滕登担任谢尔比的副官。	4	第二个州长任期	35

226	After a two-week trial in March 1960, he was convicted, fined $5,000, and sentenced to five years in prison.	1 ::: 2	Biography and career ::: 1955–1962: Signing with Chess: "Maybellene" to "Come On"	20	在1960年3月持续两周的初审后，贝里被判有罪，需支付罚款5,000美元，获刑五年。	2	1955-62年：巅峰期	20

226	When Berry was released from prison in 1963, his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands—notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs, and other bands had reworked some of them, such as the Beach Boys' 1963 hit "Surfin' U.S.A.", which used the melody of Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen".	1 ::: 3	Biography and career ::: 1963–1969: "Nadine" and move to Mercury	0	以披头士和滚石为首的英国乐队翻唱了他的歌曲，使大众保持了对他音乐的兴趣，贝里得以继续歌唱生涯。 美国乐队海滩男孩也是诸多重录他作品的团体之一，他们1963年的热门歌曲《Surfin' U.S.A.》是在《Sweet Little Sixteen》的基础上改编的。	3	1963-69年：下坡路	0

237	Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; they are not a depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed.	4	"Mona Lisa"	8	她的黑色衣服和面纱都是受西班牙影响的高级时装，而非像部分学者推测的那样是为了哀悼过世的女儿。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	8
237	The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time.	4	"Mona Lisa"	9	按当时的情况来说，这幅肖像的尺寸非常大，通常来说，画像的尺寸与艺术赞助人的富有程度成正比。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	9

237	During the spring of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his interest in a private portrait.	4	"Mona Lisa"	11	1503年春，达·芬奇没有收入来源，这有可能是他愿为私人画像的重要原因。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	11
237	But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on "Mona Lisa" when he received payment for starting "The Battle of Anghiari", which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505.	4	"Mona Lisa"	12	但到了这年晚些时候，他开始收到创作《安吉亚里战役》的报酬，金额比《蒙娜丽莎》更高，并且规定达·芬奇必须在1505年2月完成，为此他很可能不得不推迟《蒙娜丽莎》的创作。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	12
237	In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client.	4	"Mona Lisa"	13	1506年，达·芬奇仍然没有完成肖像，所以没有拿到报酬，也没有将画作交给雇主。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	13
237	The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, and he may have completed the "Mona Lisa" many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.	4	"Mona Lisa"	14	达·芬奇之后带着这幅画走遍天下，有可能过了好些年才在法国将其完成，有学者估计是在1516年完成。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	14
237	The painting's title dates to 1550.	4	"Mona Lisa"	15	画作上所标年份是1550年。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	15
237	An acquaintance of at least some of Francesco's family, Giorgio Vasari, wrote, "Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife" .	4	"Mona Lisa"	16	据与弗朗切斯科家族的部分成员相识的乔尔乔·瓦萨里记载：“列奥纳多为弗朗切斯科·德尔·焦孔多的夫人蒙娜丽莎画了一幅肖像”。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	16
237	The portrait's Italian name "La Gioconda" is the feminine form of her married name. In French it is known by the variant "La Joconde".	4	"Mona Lisa"	17	这幅画的意大利语名称“La Gioconda”和法语名称“La Joconde”都是丽莎婚后从夫的姓氏，也是她的昵称，意思是“幸福的人”。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	17
237	Speculation assigned Lisa's name to at least four different paintings and her identity to at least ten different people.	4	"Mona Lisa"	18	有观点认为，至少有四幅画作所画的是丽莎，对她身份的猜测涉及至少十人。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	18
237	By the end of the 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000 advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week.	4	"Mona Lisa"	19	到了20世纪末，《蒙娜丽莎》已成为全球性的标志，出现在另外至少300幅画作和2000部广告中，平均每星期就会有相关的新广告面世。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	19
237	In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa. The note, written by Agostino Vespucci in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo.	4	"Mona Lisa"	20	2005年，海德堡大学图书馆的一位专家在图书馆收藏文献中发现由阿戈斯蒂诺·韦斯普奇在1503年所写的边注，其中确认画像中正坐的女士就是丽莎，达·芬奇当时正在为丽莎·德尔·焦孔多画像。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	20
237	The "Mona Lisa" has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by King Francis I; after the French Revolution, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the Louvre in Paris, where it is part of a French national collection.	4	"Mona Lisa"	21	从16世纪弗朗索瓦一世拿到这幅画开始，《蒙娜丽莎》就一直由法国所有，法国大革命后成为法国人民的共同财产，如今，这幅画已是法国国家收藏的一部分，存放在巴黎的卢浮宫，平均每年前来观赏的人数高达600万。	3	《蒙娜丽莎》	21

239	In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated some of his constituency by supporting his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	8	夏普在1824年总统大选中支持的不是肯塔基州最受欢迎的人选亨利·克莱，而是曾与自己同期担任联邦众议员的约翰·卡德威尔·卡尔霍恩，此举在他和部分选民之间形成隔阂。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	8
239	When it was clear that Calhoun's bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	9	之后的形势表明卡尔霍恩没有当选的可能，夏普于是转为支持安德鲁·杰克逊。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	9

239	The Relief faction in the legislature passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	13	州议会中的赈灾派议员通过多项对债务人有利的法案，但肯塔基州上诉法院裁决其中多条违宪。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	13
239	Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	14	赈灾派议员于是试图将该院法官解职，但又无法在两院都取得所需的三分之二多数支持。 因此，赈灾派决心废除州上诉法院，建立新的最高法院，这样德沙就可以提名倾向赈灾派的法官上任。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	14
239	For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period was referred to as the Old Court-New Court controversy.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	15	两所法院互不承认，而且都自称是肯塔基州的最高法院，这一争端人称新老法院争议。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	15
239	Sharp's role in the Relief Party's plan to abolish the old court and replace it with a new, more favorable court is not known.  As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	16	夏普在新老法院争议中扮演的角色仍不为人所知，考虑到他是行政部门的首席法律顾问，历史学家相信他与此事有密切关联。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	16
239	He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	17	他亲自签署命令，要求上诉法院书记员阿喀琉斯·斯尼德把法院纪录交给新最高法院书记员弗朗西斯·普雷斯顿·布莱尔。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	17
239	By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.	3 ::: 3	Political career ::: Attorney general of Kentucky	18	作为州总检察长，夏普接受新法院、排斥老法院，这在一定程度上认可了新法院的合法性。	3 ::: 3	从政生涯 ::: 肯塔基州总检察长	18

244	On 20 September 1911, "Olympic"s first major mishap occurred during a collision with a British warship, HMS Hawke, in which the warship lost her prow.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	0	1911年9月20日，第五次出航的奧林匹克號發生第一次重大事故，這艘史無前例的巨船在港口附近產生了伯努利定律，防護巡洋艦霍克號防護巡洋艦因此無力閃避，失控撞上奧林匹克號的船尾。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	0
244	Although the collision left two of "Olympic"s compartments filled and one of her propeller shafts twisted, she was able to limp back to Southampton.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	1	撞擊事件導致奧林匹克號的兩個水密艙室被海水填滿，而且其中一個螺旋槳傳動軸扭曲，但她還是能夠航行回到南安普敦港。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	1
244	At the resultant inquiry, the Royal Navy blamed "Olympic", finding that her massive size generated a suction that pulled "Hawke" into her side.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	2	在霍克號事故的調查結果中，英國皇家海軍將肇事責任全部歸咎於奧林匹克號。 多年後人們才明白，奧林匹克號巨大船體的尺寸產生了船吸現象，將霍克號拉到她的身邊。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	2
244	Captain Smith had been on the bridge during the events.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	3	事件發生時，史密斯正在艦橋指揮。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	3
244	The "Hawke" incident was a financial disaster for White Star, and the out-of-service time for the big liner made matters worse.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	4	霍克號事故對白星航運來說是一場金融災難，奧林匹克號無法載客服務，使事情變得更糟。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	4
244	"Olympic" returned to Belfast and, to speed up the repairs, Harland and Wolff was forced to delay "Titanic"s completion, in order to use one of her propeller shafts and other parts for "Olympic".	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	5	受損的奧林匹克號返回貝爾法斯特，為了加快維修，哈蘭德與沃爾夫造船廠只能推遲鐵達尼號的完工，以便將她的一個螺旋槳傳動軸和其他零件用來修理奧林匹克號。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	5
244	Back at sea in February 1912, "Olympic" lost a propeller blade and once again returned to her builder for emergency repairs.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	6	1912年2月，奧林匹克號修復完成，回到海上營運，結果又丟失了螺旋槳葉片，再次返回造船廠進行緊急維修。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	6
244	To get her back to service immediately, Harland and Wolff again had to pull resources from "Titanic", delaying her maiden voyage from 20 March to 10 April.	3 ::: 4	Career ::: The "Hawke" incident	7	為了讓她立即恢復服務，造船廠不得不再次從鐵達尼號中拆下零件來用。 鐵達尼號的首航因此從3月20日延遲到4月10日。	3 ::: 4	海事生涯 ::: 霍克號事故	7

244	He immediately went to his cabin to get the sailing report from Chief Officer Henry Wilde.	4	RMS "Titanic"	3	他立即前往他在艦橋後方的辦公室，聽取大副亨利·魏爾德的航行報告。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	3
244	After departure at noon, the huge amount of water displaced by "Titanic" as she passed caused the laid-up "New York" to break from her moorings and swing towards "Titanic."	4	RMS "Titanic"	4	當天12時，鐵達尼號正式離港啟航，但是片刻之間又產生了伯努利定律，大量水流將一旁的紐約號客輪舉起，從繫泊處突然失控轉向鐵達尼號。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	4
244	It was soon apparent that the ship was seriously damaged; designer Thomas Andrews reported that all of the first five of the ship's watertight compartments had been breached and that "Titanic" would sink in under two hours.	4	RMS "Titanic"	5	他很快就發現這艘船嚴重受損；史密斯和總設計師湯瑪斯·安德魯斯進行快速檢查後，安德魯斯報告稱，船上前五個水密艙室都已被破壞，鐵達尼號將在兩小時內下沉，他立刻下令準備救生艇。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	5
244	There are conflicting reports about Smith's actions during the evacuation.	4	RMS "Titanic"	6	在疏散過程中，史密斯意識到所有乘客和船員都沒有足夠的救生艇，他們竭盡全力防止恐慌並儘力協助疏散。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	6
244	Some say that he did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club said "He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats".	4	RMS "Titanic"	7	頭等艙乘客加拿大皇家遊艇俱樂部少校亞瑟·戈弗雷·普烏欽表示：「他正竭盡全力讓女性進入這些救生艇，並看到她們被妥善降下。我認為他正在履行降下救生艇的職責」。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	7
244	Robert Williams Daniel, a first class passenger, also said:  Captain Smith was the biggest hero I ever saw.	4	RMS "Titanic"	8	另一位頭等艙乘客羅伯特·威廉·丹尼爾也說： 史密斯船長是我見過的最偉大的英雄。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	8
244	He stood on the bridge and shouted through a megaphone, trying to make himself heard.	4	RMS "Titanic"	9	他站在艦橋上，用擴音器喊叫，試圖讓人們聽見他說話。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	9
244	Just minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing "Titanic" crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John "Jack" Phillips from their duties.	4	RMS "Titanic"	10	在鐵達尼號開始劇烈下沉之前幾分鐘，史密斯仍在忙著通知鐵達尼號船員「各自逃命」的命令，他去了馬可尼電報室，告訴電報員傑克·菲利浦和哈羅德·布萊德「各自逃命」。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	10
244	He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: "Now it's every man for himself."	4	RMS "Titanic"	11	然後，他到小艇甲板進行了最後一次巡視，告訴船員：「現在各自逃命吧！」。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	11
244	At 2:10 a.m., Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say "Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves."	4	RMS "Titanic"	12	4月15日2時10分，餐廳服務員愛德華·布朗看到船長手裡拿著擴音器接近，然後聽到他說：「好孩子們，為女人和小孩盡力而為，自己照顧自己」。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	12
244	He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone.	4	RMS "Titanic"	13	接著，他看到船長獨自走到艦橋。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	13
244	This was the last reliable sighting of Smith.	4	RMS "Titanic"	14	這是史密斯最後一次可靠的行蹤報告。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	14
244	A few minutes later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.	4	RMS "Titanic"	15	幾分鐘後，司燈山繆·歐內斯特·海明發現艦橋似乎沒人了。	3 ::: 5	海事生涯 ::: 擔任鐵達尼號船長	15

244	There are conflicting accounts of Smith's death.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	0	的最終命運並不明確，因為他的死亡紀錄存在矛盾。	4	死亡	0
244	Some survivors said they saw Smith enter the ship's wheelhouse on the bridge, and die there when it was engulfed.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	1	一些生還者表示，他們看見史密斯進入艦橋操舵室，並在沉沒時淹死在裡面。	4	死亡	1
244	The "New York Herald" in its 19 April 1912 edition quoted Robert Williams Daniel, who jumped from the stern immediately before the ship sank, in its 19 April 1912 edition as having claimed to have witnessed Captain Smith drown in the ship's wheelhouse. ""I saw Captain Smith on the bridge.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	2	1912年4月19日的《紐約先驅報》引用了頭等艙乘客羅伯特·威廉·丹尼爾的說法，他表示在船沉沒之前，目睹史密斯淹死在艦橋操舵室裡： 我看到史密斯船長在艦橋上。	4	死亡	2
244	My eyes seemingly clung to him.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	3	我的眼睛緊緊盯著他看。	4	死亡	3
244	The deck from which I had leapt was immersed.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	4	我跳下的甲板沉浸在海水裡。	4	死亡	4
244	The water had risen slowly, and was now to the floor of the bridge.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	5	水緩緩上升，淹到艦橋的地板上。	4	死亡	5
244	Then it was to Captain Smith's waist.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	6	然後淹到史密斯船長的腰部。	4	死亡	6
244	I saw him no more.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	7	我就再也看不見他了。	4	死亡	7
244	He died a hero.""	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	8	他像個英雄一樣死去。	4	死亡	8
244	Captain Smith himself made statements hinting that he would go down with his ship if he was ever confronted with a disaster.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	9	史密斯在生前發表過聲明，暗示如果他遇到災難，他會跟著船沉沒。	4	死亡	9
244	A friend of Smith's, Dr. Williams, asked Captain Smith what would happen if the "Adriatic" struck a concealed reef of ice and was badly damaged.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	10	他的一位朋友威廉姆斯博士曾向他問道，如果亞得里亞號撞到隱藏的冰礁並嚴重受損，將會發生什麼。	4	死亡	10
244	"Some of us would go to the bottom with the ship," was Smith's reply.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	11	史密斯的答覆是「我們中的一些人會隨船觸底」。	4	死亡	11
244	A boyhood friend, William Jones said, "Ted Smith passed away just as he would have loved to do. To stand on the bridge of his vessel and go down with her was characteristic of all his actions when we were boys together."	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	12	他另一位少年時期的朋友威廉·瓊斯說：「史密斯就像他本來喜歡的那樣去世了。站在艦橋上和他的船一起沉下去，就是他會做的事。當我們還是男孩的時候我就知道了」。	4	死亡	12
244	Because of these factors as well as the accounts of Smith going inside the wheelhouse, this has remained the iconic image which has remained of Smith and has been perpetuated by film portrayals.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	13	由於這些因素以及史密斯進入操舵室的說法，這一直是史密斯流傳給世人的標誌性形象，並且已經有許多電影描寫、延續下去。	4	死亡	13
244	When working to free Collapsible B, Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride said he saw Captain Smith dive from the bridge into the sea just as Collapsible B was levered off the roof of the officers' quarters, a story which was corroborated by first class passenger Mrs Eleanor Widener, who was in Lifeboat No.4  at the time.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	14	初級電報員哈羅德·布萊德表示，他在努力解開B折疊艇時，看到史密斯船長從艦橋跳入海水中，就像B折疊艇從海官起居艙的頂部掉下去一樣，這個說法得到一些頭等艙乘客的證實，例如愛蓮娜·懷德納，當時她在4號救生艇。	4	死亡	14
244	Also second class passenger William John Mellors, who survived aboard collapsible B, stated that Smith jumped from the bridge.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	15	還有在A折疊艇上倖存下來的二等艙乘客威廉·約翰·梅洛斯，他說史密斯從艦橋上跳下來。	4	死亡	15
244	Tim Maltin, author of "101 Things You Thought You Knew About The Titanic - But Didn't!" affirms that the witnesses "could here be mistaking Captain Smith for Lightoller, who we know did exactly this at this time, first swimming towards the crow's nest."	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	16	《101個對鐵達尼號的誤解》作者、歷史學家提姆·馬丁證實，上述證人「可能在這裡錯誤的將二副萊托勒誤認為是史密斯船長，我們都知道那時後萊托勒也正跳入水中，他首先要向桅杆瞭望台游去」。	4	死亡	16
244	Several accounts say that Smith may have been seen in the water near the overturned Collapsible B during or after the sinking.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	17	有幾個生還者表示，在沉沒期間或之後可能已經在B折疊艇附近的水中看到史密斯。	4	死亡	17
244	Gracie did not see this man, nor was able to identify him, but some other survivors later claimed to have recognised this man as Smith.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	18	格雷西沒有看到這個男人，也沒有認出他是誰，但其他一些生還者後來表示，已經認出這個人是史密斯。	4	死亡	18
244	Another man  never asked to come aboard the boat, but instead cheered its occupants saying "Good boys! Good lads!” with "the voice of authority".	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	19	另一名男子從未要求爬上折疊艇，而是以「有權威感的聲音」對著上面的人歡呼其居住者說：「好孩子！好傢伙們！」。	4	死亡	19
244	One of the Collapsible B survivors, fireman Walter Hurst, tried to reach him with an oar, but the rapidly rising swell carried the man away before he could reach him.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	20	另一名B折疊艇生還者——生火員／加煤工沃爾特·赫斯特試圖用槳將這位落海者拉到他身邊，但海浪迅速升起，在他能夠接觸到落海者之前就消失了。	4	死亡	20
244	Hurst said he was certain this man was Smith.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	21	赫斯特表示，他確信這個人是史密斯。	4	死亡	21
244	Some of these accounts also describe Smith carrying a child to the boat.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	22	一些證詞也描述了史密斯帶著一個孩子登上救生艇。	4	死亡	22
244	Harry Senior, one of "Titanic"'s stokers, and second class passenger Charles Eugene Williams, who both survived aboard Collapsible B, stated that Smith swam with a child in his arms to Collapsible B, which Smith presented to a steward, after which he apparently swam back to the rapidly foundering ship.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	23	生火員／加煤工哈利·西尼爾與二等艙乘客查爾斯·尤金·威廉斯都說，史密斯抱著一個小孩，游到B折疊艇附近，當史密斯將小孩傳遞給一位服務員後，顯然遊回了快速沉沒的鐵達尼號。	4	死亡	23
244	Williams' account differs slightly, claiming that, after Smith handed the child over to the steward, he asked what had become of First Officer Murdoch.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	24	威廉斯的證詞有些不同，他表示在史密斯把孩子交給服務員後，他問到了一副默多克的情況。	4	死亡	24
244	Upon hearing news of Murdoch's demise, Smith "pushed himself away from the lifeboat, threw his lifebelt from him and slowly sank from our sight. He did not come to the surface again."	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	25	在聽到默多克死亡的消息後，史密斯「將自己從救生艇上推開，將救生衣從他身上脫了下來，慢慢從我們的視線中沉沒。他沒有再次浮出水面」。	4	死亡	25
244	These accounts are almost certainly apocryphal, according to historians featured in the A&E Documentary "".	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	26	根據紀錄片《鐵達尼號：完整故事》中歷史學家的說法，這些說法幾乎肯定是偽造的。	4	死亡	26
244	Lightoller who survived on Collapsible B never reported seeing Smith in the water or receiving a child from him.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	27	同樣也在B折疊艇倖存下來的二副萊托勒從未報告過在水中看到史密斯，也沒說過有人從他那裡接過一個孩子。	4	死亡	27
244	There is also no way in which survivors on Collapsible B would have been able to verify the identity of the individual concerned under such dimly lit and chaotic circumstances.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	28	在如此昏暗和混亂的情況下，B折疊艇的生還者也無法核實有關個人的身份。	4	死亡	28
244	It is more likely based upon wishful thinking that the person they saw was the Captain.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	29	更有可能基於一廂情願的想法，他們以為看到的人是船長。	4	死亡	29
244	Captain Smith's fate will probably remain uncertain.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	30	史密斯的最終命運仍然不能確定。	4	死亡	30
244	For many years, there were also conflicting accounts of Smith's last words.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	31	多年來，史密斯所說的遺言也有相互矛盾的說法。	4	死亡	31
244	Newspaper reports said that as the final plunge began, Smith advised those on board to "Be British boys, be British!"	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	32	報紙報導稱，隨著最後的劇烈下沉開始，史密斯呼籲船上的人「當個堂堂正正的英國男孩，當個堂堂正正的英國人！」。	4	死亡	32
244	Although this is engraved on his memorial and portrayed in the 1996 TV miniseries, it is a myth popularised by the British press at the time.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	33	雖然這段話刻在他的紀念碑上，並在1996年的《鐵達尼號》電視劇中描寫過，但它是英國媒體普及的一個神話。	4	死亡	33
244	If Smith had said these words to anyone, it would have been to the crew, but not one of the surviving crew members claimed he did.	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	34	如果史密斯曾對任何人說過這些話，那應該是說給船員聽的，但是沒有任何一個生還船員證實史密斯說過這句話。	4	死亡	34
244	Because Steward Brown's account of Smith giving orders before walking onto the bridge was the last reliable sighting, this would make Smith's last words simply "Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves."	4 ::: 1	RMS "Titanic" ::: Death	35	特別是最後一次可靠的行蹤報告是由餐廳服務員愛德華·布朗提供，他證實史密斯最後講的話是「好孩子們，為女人和小孩盡力而為，自己照顧自己」。	4	死亡	35

245	It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the Low Countries, France, Portugal.	1	Biography	5	这是当时第一部由意大利人创作的弥撒曲集，此前的弥撒曲集多出自低地国家如法国，葡萄牙等国。	1	生平	5
245	The madrigals were a bit embarrassing, since everyone expected him to be the champion of pure church music.	1	Biography	6	同年由教皇推荐，未经考试就得到当时教会音乐家的最高荣誉──教皇合唱团歌手。	1	生平	6
245	Palestrina was able to compose prolifically until his 1594 death in Rome of pleurisy.	1	Biography	7	帕莱斯特里纳1594年因胸膜炎死于罗马。	1	生平	7
245	As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed "Libera me Domine".	1	Biography	8	按照当时习俗，他的遗体在其逝世当天就被下葬。 他的棺木上铭刻了"圣歌之王"。	1	生平	8
245	Palestrina's masses show how his compositional style developed over time.	2	Music	0	由帕莱斯特里纳的弥撒曲可以看出他不同時間作品風格的演變。	2	音乐	0
245	His "Missa sine nomine" seems to have been particularly attractive to Johann Sebastian Bach, who studied and performed it while writing the Mass in B minor.	2	Music	1	巴哈特別喜歡他的 Missa sine nomine，在編寫B小調彌撒曲時研究及演奏了這首弥撒曲。	2	音乐	1
245	Most of Palestrina's masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death.	2	Music	2	大部份帕莱斯特里纳的弥撒曲都是在1554年到1601年出版的十三本作品集中，最後的七本是在帕莱斯特里纳死後才出版。	2	音乐	2
245	One of his most important works, the "Missa Papae Marcelli" , has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent.	2	Music	3	帕莱斯特里纳的作品《马塞勒斯教皇弥撒》曾被錯誤的認為和特倫托會議有關，此說法也是普菲茨納創作歌劇《帕萊斯特里納 》的基礎。	2	音乐	3
245	According to this tale , it was composed in order to persuade the Council of Trent that a draconian ban on the polyphonic treatment of text in sacred music  was unnecessary.	2	Music	4	依此說法，編寫马塞勒斯教皇弥撒是為了遊說特倫托會議放弃聖樂中复调音乐的限制。	2	音乐	4
245	However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban .	2	Music	5	不過近期的研究發現該弥撒曲的作曲時間是在討論复调音乐的禁令之前。	2	音乐	5
245	Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject.	2	Music	6	歷史資料也指出特倫托會議沒有禁止任何教會音樂，也沒有針對教會音樂訂定任何規定或正式文件。	2	音乐	6
245	These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the Council's deliberations.	2	Music	7	這些故事起源自特倫托會議參與者的個人看法，不代表特倫托會議的官方意見。	2	音乐	7
245	Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts.	2	Music	8	不過過了幾世紀，這些傳聞被誤認為是事實，編寫成書。	2	音乐	8
245	While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the Counter-Reformation, because no such doctrine exists.	2	Music	9	帕莱斯特里纳創作此弥撒曲的原因不明，不過因為找不到類似的禁令，其創作也看不出和反宗教改革有關。	2	音乐	9
245	His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life.	2	Music	10	帕莱斯特里纳的風格從1560年代一直到他逝世都保持一致。	2	音乐	10
245	One of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the "weak" beats in a measure.	3	The 'Palestrina Style'	0	帕莱斯特里纳音樂的特點是不和諧的部份多半會限制在一小節中的弱拍。	2	音乐	11
245	This produced a smoother and more consonant type of polyphony which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer  in the wake of Josquin des Prez .	3	The 'Palestrina Style'	1	因此產生了更流暢的复调音乐，現在認為這是文藝復興後期音樂的風格，因此將帕莱斯特里纳譽為在若斯坎·德普雷之後，歐洲頂級的作曲家。	2	音乐	12
245	The "Palestrina style" taught in college courses covering Renaissance counterpoint is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux, published as "Gradus ad Parnassum" .	3	The 'Palestrina Style'	2	「帕莱斯特里纳風格」視為是文藝復興時期对位法的基礎，大部份是歸功於18世紀作曲家及音樂理論家約翰·約瑟夫·富克斯，在他的《藝術津梁》中將帕莱斯特里纳的技巧編寫為學生作曲的工具。	2	音乐	13

246	According to the Russian publication "Rossiyskaya Gazeta", he might have left because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector.

246	In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him "a very suspicious character", he wrote to Kramish.	3	Later years	3	回到苏联后，科瓦尔从苏联军队以二等兵的身份退伍，但是由于他的海外背景和服役记录显得十分可疑，寻找教职的过程很不顺利。	4	战后	3

246	Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another possibility is that the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies.	3	Later years	7	一种可能的原因是，各部门间的政治使得对雇员的背景检查造成了不利影响；另一种可能性是，美国政府认为科学能力比清白的案底、对苏联的政治同情等因素更重要。	4	战后	7

246	The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.	3	Later years	9	这一调查保密了六十年，原因是美国政府害怕科瓦尔活动的曝光对政府形象的损害。	4	战后	9

246	However, he ended his correspondence by saying that he was not protesting his treatment; "[I am thankful] that I did not find myself in a Gulag, as might well have happened".	3	Later years	12	然而，他不认为他在抗议他受到的对待，因为他没有被投入古拉格，这足以使他感到庆幸。	4	战后	12

246	Koval's activities as a spy began to emerge after the publication of a 2002 book, "The GRU and the Atomic Bomb", which mentioned Koval by his code name and listed him as one of a handful of spies who evaded counterintelligence groups.	3	Later years	14	科瓦尔的间谍活动随着2002年《格鲁乌和原子弹》一书的出版开始曝光，书中提及了科瓦尔的代号，将其列为若干逃脱了美国反情报组织追踪的间谍之一。	4	战后	14
246	On November 3, 2007, he received the posthumous title of Hero of the Russian Federation bestowed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. When Koval was honored, the Russian presidential proclamation stated, "Mr Koval, who operated under the pseudonym Delmar, provided information that helped speed up considerably the time it took for the Soviet Union to develop an atomic bomb of its own".	3	Later years	15	2007年11月3日，俄罗斯总统普京在科瓦尔逝世一年后向其追授俄罗斯联邦英雄勋章，公告宣称：“科瓦尔先生提供的情报大幅降低了苏联研发核武器耗费的时间”。	4	战后	15

257	Another version of the story states that William rode to Matilda's father's house in Lille, threw her to the ground in her room  and hit her  before leaving. Naturally, Baldwin took offence at this; but, before they could draw swords, Matilda settled the matter by refusing to marry anyone but William; even a papal ban by Pope Leo IX at the Council of Reims on the grounds of consanguinity did not dissuade her.	1	Marriage	2	故事情节的另一个版本是威廉骑马去玛蒂尔达的父亲在里尔的住处，把她扔在她房间的地上，并在离开之前打她，鲍德温自然对此很生气，在他们拔出剑之前，玛蒂尔达决定和威廉结婚才化解了冲突,甚至教皇的禁令也没能阻止她。	1	生平	2
