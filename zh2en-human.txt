4	The British had taken to account Singapore's future early during Marshall's tenure as Chief Minister.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	1	早在马绍尔在任首席部长时，英方已考虑过新加坡的前途问题。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	1
4	The British had agreed to Malaya's  independence, and due to the strategic value of Singapore's geography, the British wanted to continue taking control over foreign and defence affairs of Singapore. Hence, the British are inclined to granting Singapore self-governance instead of independence.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	2	鉴于英方当时已同意马来亚迈向独立，考虑到新加坡在地理上的战略价值，英政府认为长远有必要继续控制新加坡的外交和防卫事务，因此英方只倾向让新加坡获得自治，而不希望新加坡独立。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	2
4	Though Sir Robert Black, the then-Governor had taken a more open and friendly approach to self-governance for Singapore, as compared to his predecessor Sir John Nicoll, he believed in gradual self-governance. If the handover of power were to be carried out too hastily, self-governing political leaders might not have sufficient experience in governing.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	3	时任总督柏立基爵士虽然比他的前任列诰爵士对新加坡争取自治采取更加开明和友善的态度，但却认为自治进程应该循序渐进地进行；如果推行过急，他担心权力交接过快，将迫使政府仓促推行公务员本地化，最终导致新加坡自治后透过本地化提拔的政府高官缺乏充足的管治经验。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	3
4	When Marshall led a delegation in March to May 1956 to negotiate talks with the British for self-rule, Black emphasised the priority of internal security issues, while anti-colonialist LF was ineffective in suppression of the series of riots incited by the communists. As a result, talks broke down and complete self-rule was refused.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	4	在这个背景下，马绍尔等人在1956年3月至5月与英方就新加坡自治展开谈判时，正因为柏立基强调新加坡应先解决内部保安问题才具备落实自治的条件，再加上身为劳工阵线主席的马绍尔一直以反殖民主义为号召，在首席部长任内却未能有效打击境内由左派煽动的连串骚动和暴力事件，再加上他坚持争取新加坡全面独立、拒不退让，终使英方认为时机尚未成熟，拒绝支持新加坡落实全面自治，致使谈判破裂。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	4
4	To enhance the internal security, Lim arrested the leftist trade union members, teachers and students under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance, in September to October 1956 and August 1957 upon taking office. Some of them were deported. In addition, alleged pro-communist organisations such as the Singapore Women's Association, the Chinese Musical Gong Society and the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students Union were banned by the authorities.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	5	针对新加坡内部保安之强化，林有福甫上任便于1956年9月至11月以及1957年8月引用《维护公众安全条例》，两度大举搜捕境内的左派激进工运人物、教师和学生，部份人士更被驱逐出境；在1956年的行动中，大量被指亲共的组织如新加坡妇女联合会、新加坡铜锣合唱团和新加坡华文中学学生联合会等均遭到当局封禁。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	5
4	The series of raids prompted the teachers and students from Chinese schools in October 1956 to launch sit-in protests at Chung Cheng High School and The Chinese High School, eventually escalating into riots.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	6	连串的大规模搜捕行动，触发不少声援被捕人士的华文学校师生在1956年10月于中正中学和华侨中学发起静坐抗议，最终演变成为大规模骚动。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	6
4	Under the support of Black, the riot police were dispatched by Lim to clear the school grounds. The Government also imposed a curfew from 26 October to 2 November, suppressing the riots effectively.	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	Life ::: Chief Minister ::: Chinese schools riots	7	在该次骚动中，林有福在柏立基的支持下于1956年10月26日派出防暴警察进校清场，政府方面也在10月26日至11月2日实施宵禁，从而有效平息了骚动。	1 ::: 4 ::: 1	生平 ::: 首席部長 ::: 華校騷動	7

While in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman spoke to the Australian reporters over the telephone, calling for Lim to show up; The Tunku said, "My friend, come back, I will welcome you, and am willing to let bygones be bygones.	1 ::: 5	Life ::: Political involvement in the Federation	11	期间，林有福夫人更接受澳洲电视台专访，声泪俱下地要求丈夫及早归来；至于在另一场合，大马政府特使向记者表示林有福有可能「被石头绊倒受伤，现正接受一位我们不知到身份的好人照顾」；马来西亚总理东姑也在大马首都吉隆坡接受澳洲记者长途电话访问，呼吁林有福现身，并表示「我的好友，回来吧，我会欢迎你的，我很乐意让过去的事成为过去」，听起来似有弦外之音。	1 ::: 5	生平 ::: 大馬政壇	11

27	Fueled by his love of racing, Han became a professional rally driver and wrote less frequently.  However, he continued to blog on current affairs, with some articles attracting a large number of readers and sparking intense debates.	1	Early life and increasing prominence	3	沉寂几年后，韩寒成为一名职业赛车手，但不时通过博客继续发表了一系列的批评现政权的的博文，使他的博客成为中国点击率极高的博客，也因此博文经常遭禁，其中一些博文引起了网络社区内的激烈讨论。	1	经历	3

27	On 19 April 2009, Han launched his online bookstore, "Han Han's Bookstore", on the Taobao online shopping marketplace .  The bookstore site stated that it would sell only Han's original autographed books.  As the number of sales transactions on Han Han's Bookstore was unusually large, the online system erroneously classified these as false transactions and attempts at credit fraud, leading Taobao to investigate the issue.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	0	2009年4月19日，韩寒在淘宝网开了名为“韩寒的书店”的网上书店，书店网页标称只卖自己的亲笔签名的正版图书，由于书店销量过大，交易次数过多，一度被网站系统辨识为虚假交易与炒作信用而对其进行查封。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	0
27	On 1 May 2009, Han posted an article on his blog entitled "Request for articles, recruitment, article fees and article submission email address for a new magazine’'.  The post mentioned that Han would be setting up a magazine, informing the email addresses for article submission, response to recruitment ads, and advertising offers, but without revealing the magazine's title to prevent illegal copying.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	1	2009年5月1日，韩寒在其新浪网的博客发表名为《新杂志的征稿信，征人信，稿费标准，投稿邮箱》的文章，文章介绍，韩寒自己将开办杂志，但为了防止市场上出现盗版，文中并没有写出杂志名称，只是给出了用于投稿、应聘和广告合作的联系邮箱。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	1
27	The blog post also mentioned that the writer of the selected cover story, if the story had not been previously published, would get up to RMB 2,000 per 1,000 characters in article fees. This would be 10 to 40 times of the standard rate in China's publishing industry, and 2 to 4 times higher than what China's top magazine would pay China's top writer for an article. Writers of previously unpublished non-cover story articles in the magazine would be paid RMB 1,000 per 1,000 characters, 10 to 20 times higher than standard rates in the publishing industry. As for previously-published articles or selected extracts from articles, the rate would be RMB 500 per 1,000 characters, which would be about 15 times the standard rates. Contributors of photographs would be paid up to RMB 5,000 per photograph.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	2	值得关注的是，韩寒在文章中介绍到，自己办的杂志中，封面推荐的原创文章，稿费是1000字/2000元，并透露这个稿费标准已经是中国出版行业标准的10到40倍，比中国最顶尖杂志付给顶尖作家的约稿费高出2到4倍：而普通稿件的稿费也有1000字/1000元，高出现行出版行业标准的10到20倍之多，对于已发表过的或被杂志摘录的文章，稿费是1000字/500元，也已经是现行标准的15倍，照片的稿费更是达到5000元。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	2
27	Han also invited article submissions for a "braindead"  column, deliberately publishing articles that the magazine disagreed with or were not up to standards. The rate for such articles would be RMB 250 per 1,000 characters. 250  is a Chinese slang with the same meaning of "You idiot”.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	3	韩寒在文章中还写到，自办杂志将开设一栏脑残来稿，稿费设为1000字/250元，以彰显文章观点与文笔吻合作者形象。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	3
27	Han gave the rationale for including this column: Every issue of the magazine would include 2 to 3 articles with the worst viewpoints or the lowest standards of writing, as examples of articles which the magazine completely disagreed with or found the most unsuitable.  These articles could be stupid, against humanity, against common sense, against righteousness or anti-freedom. In conformance with the standards of these articles, the writers would be paid a relatively low RMB 250 per 1,000 words if compared with other types of articles, still a high rate if compared to publishing industry standards.  I had reasons for deciding on this rate.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	4	以下是韩寒在其博文《新杂志的征稿信，征人信，稿费标准，投稿邮箱》中关于1000字/250元稿费的描述：杂志每期还设有最差观点和文笔的文章两篇到三篇，表示杂志完全不认同作者的观点，杂志认为作者脑残，反人类反常识反正义反自由，杂志也会发表此类并且示众，为了表示和这些人的形象的吻合，所以这类文章的稿费标准是1000字/250元，也是非常高的标准，250从来不是从天而降的，250的诞生也是有成本的。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	4
27	Within five days of putting up the blog post, Han received over 10,000 article submissions from across China, and also a few thousand résumés.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	5	在发表文章5天后，韩寒尚未出炉的杂志已收到各地的投稿一万多封，而应聘简历也有数千封。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	5
27	There were several articles of the types which Han had expressly forbidden from submission, such as cut and paste jobs, pornographic literature and dissertations.  Han expressed his exasperation with these and declared that such articles would not be published.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	6	有意思的是，在这些投稿中，韩寒发现了几篇在之前声明文章中明令禁止的复制粘贴类、黄色小说类和毕业论文类文章，韩寒表示无奈，并声明不会刊登发表这类文章。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	6
27	Han's setup of his magazine received widespread attention, with editors proclaiming that the higher fees enabled the writing profession to regain a measure of financial independence and dignity.  One journalist even commented that Han had completed his transformation from a rebellious youth into a full-fledged intellectual.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	7	办杂志之事得到了社会的关注，有编辑称其挽救了文人人格，一记者评价韩寒已经完成了从叛逆青年到知识分子的转变。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	7
27	Due to certain publishing and circulation restrictions in China, Han's magazine, which was originally planned for publication in August 2009, remained unpublished for some time. One of the delays was reportedly because of an article that detailed the blacklisting of actors.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	8	但由于在中国对出版和发行方面的一些限制，韩寒计划于2009年8月出版的杂志《独唱团》在推迟近一年后，才于2010年7月6日上市。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	8
27	On July 6, 2010, his magazine "Party"  was finally published. According to the publisher, the magazine became the most popular book on Amazon.cn less than 10 hours after pre-selling. However, it only lasted one issue.	3	Setup of online bookstore and magazine	9	尽管如此，读者们依然热情不减，该书的发行方华文天下宣布，预售上线不到10小时，《独唱团》就已经凭借预售量登上了卓越销售总榜的第1位。	1 ::: 1	经历 ::: 网上书店与创办杂志	9

27	After Han turned professional as a rally driver, there were rumours that he had encountered financial difficulties.  Han himself admitted that writers and race car drivers in China earned less compared to those in other professions.  Furthermore, his only income source was from book royalties as he was not involved in other revenue generating activities.	4	Rally racing career	0	在转为职业赛车后，韩寒一度传闻陷入财务危机，自己也承认相比其他职业，中国的作家和赛车手收入较少，加上自己没有参与商业活动，经济来源也只有书的版税。	1 ::: 2	经历 ::: 赛车生涯	0
27	However, he continued to race as it gave him a sense of achievement.  Winning prizes also enabled him to prove to himself that he was a well-rounded learner.	4	Rally racing career	1	但赛车方面有成就感，夺冠也证明了自己是全面发展的好学生。	1 ::: 2	经历 ::: 赛车生涯	1
27	As Han stated in a media interview in 2007: My income is from book royalties.  I don't have a head for business and stocks, and I don't invest in trust funds.  Racing is an expensive activity, and this frequently causes my family financial difficulties. I don't take part in [other] revenue generating activities, and I decline many such offers every year. [Taking advantage of racing-related] advertising opportunities would earn me more than RMB 3 million, but I'm afraid that once I get started in this, I would not be able to stop.	4	Rally racing career	2	以下是韩寒在2007年接受采访时说的话：我的收入就是书的版税，我没有商业头脑，股票、基金从来不买，玩赛车是最费钱的，弄得家里常常揭不开锅。—韩寒我自己从不做任何商业活动，每年推掉很多，光这些广告收入就有300多万，我怕干了就收不住。	1 ::: 2	经历 ::: 赛车生涯	2
27	On 2 March 2006, Chinese literary critic and bookseller Bai Ye  published a blog post entitled, "Status and Future of the Post-80 Generation" , a harsh criticism of the works of writers born in the 1980-1989 period.

There are three types of paintings: the first ones are those extraordinarily similar to the object, which are false paintings. The second ones are those not similar to the objects at all, which are always painter’s spiritual expression by image. They are also false paintings. The third ones are those between the above extremes which can be called true paintings.  They are much higher, stronger, more centralized, typical and ideal than real life. So they are more universal. Sense and sensibility as well as form and spirit can not be divided. “	1	Life	24	1989年，他曾写道：“我之所以主张‘写意戏剧观’，乃是根据五六十年来的舞台实践、世界戏剧界发展史的苦心钻研和以下几句众所周知的名言而形成的：虚戈作戏，真假宜人，不像不成戏，是戏又是艺；画有三：绝像物象者，此欺世盗名之画，绝不似物象者，往往托名写意，此亦欺世盗名之画，惟绝似又绝不似者，此乃真画；比普通实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此更带普遍性；情与理，形与神，不可分割。”	1	生平	24

147	It was the last post he held in the Home Ministry, which was disbanded by the General Headquarters of the Allied Powers in December 1947. As a transitional arrangement decided in a Cabinet meeting, he was appointed Director of the temporarily established Office of Domestic Affairs in January 1948.

147	While the Japanese constitution was being redrafted and the Japanese war criminals were under trial, there were a number of unusual senior staff changes in the Imperial Household Office  between June and August 1948. In particular, two key imperial household officials in the early post-war period, Ogane Masujiro, the Grand Chamberlain, and Susumu Katō, Vice-Minister of Imperial Household, relinquished their offices. In the reshuffle, Hayashi succeeded Katō on 2 August 1948. By the time when he left the post in 1950, he had become a confidant of Emperor Showa, making him one of the few people who had the privilege to see and talk to the Emperor.	1 ::: 2	Biography ::: Civil service career	5	同年6月至8月間，正值憲法改正與戰犯審判實施之際，宮內府也進行了人事異動，支撐戰敗後宮廷事務的兩位天皇近侍——大金益次郎侍從長及加藤進 次長均辭官告退，林敬三於8月2日入府接替加藤的次長職位，一直當到1950年為止，並成為昭和天皇的親信，也是當時日本少數能與天皇見面、對話的人士之一。	1 ::: 2	生平 ::: 文職生涯	5
147	After the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, there was a vacuum of defense in Japan as the United States  redeployed much of its troops from Japan to the Korean Peninsula. Against this background, the GHQ started to formulate plans to allow Japan rearm itself by setting up the National Police Reserve  as the foundation of post-war Japan's self-defense power.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	0	1950年6月韓戰爆發後，駐日美軍大量開赴朝鮮半島，日本防衛產生空缺，盟軍總部遂考慮讓日本重整軍備，籌建警察預備隊，打造日本新武裝組織雛形。	1 ::: 3	生平 ::: 武職生涯	0
147	As a policy endorsed by the United Nations  and the American occupation authority, the backbone of the NPR had to be formed by civilian officials and police officers from the ex-Home Ministry, while prewar Japanese military officials were barred from joining the NPR.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	1	但在聯合國方針及美國初期佔領政策下，舊日軍軍官不得參加預備隊，故部隊幹部來源由內務省文官和警察取代。	1 ::: 3	生平 ::: 武職生涯	1
147	Although the policy was supported by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and Supreme Commander General Douglas MacArthur, it was met with some opposition from within the GHQ. For example, Major-General Charles A. Willoughby, Chief of Intelligence  on General MacArthur's staff, attempted to recommend Takushiro Hattori, the former head of Operations Section of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, to command the NPR, a recommendation which was strongly opposed by Yoshida.  Another prewar Japanese military officer, Eiichi Tatsumi, however, turned down the same offer even though he was a military adviser to Yoshida, who viewed him as an acceptable choice.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	2	另一方面，首相吉田茂和盟軍總司令道格拉斯·麥克阿瑟也都反對前軍人接掌職務，盟軍總部參謀二部部長查爾斯·威洛比少將推薦的指揮官人選——原日本陸軍參謀本部作戰課長服部卓四郎即遭吉田抵制，內閣軍事顧問辰巳榮一亦拒絕出任此職。	1 ::: 3	生平 ::: 武職生涯	2
147	In early September 1950, Yoshida nominated Hayashi to head the NPR with support from the Emperor, who not only had confidence in Hayashi, but also appreciated his performance as Vice-Minister of Imperial Household.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	3	1950年9月上旬，吉田茂提出了由林敬三出任警察預備隊指揮官的建議，昭和天皇也曾授意吉田任用具備宮內廳次長資歷、與其親近的林氏。	1 ::: 3	生平 ::: 武職生涯	3
147	This time the nomination of Hayashi was opposed by Willoughby and his intelligence staff, which was responsible for recruitment matters of NPR.  They not only favored Hattori and other prewar Japanese army officers, but also even tried to prevent Hayashi from getting appointed. Nevertheless, their views were not shared by other parties within the GHQ. In particular, both Brigadier-General Courtney Whitney, Chief of the Government Section , which was responsible for the NPR's personnel matters, and Major-General Whitfield P. Shepard, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section Annex , which was responsible for the development and training of the NPR, favored Hayashi.  Operations Section  of the GHQ, which dealt with military operations, law enforcement and repatriation, also showed their support to Hayashi.  Because of Willoughby's opposition, the nomination of Hayashi dragged on for a month and it took a few more weeks before the nomination was approved only after the intervention of MacArthur and Yoshida.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	4	然而美方各機構卻對此事意見不一，負責隊員招募、以威洛比為首的參謀二部偏好服部卓四郎等舊軍將校，阻撓林敬三的任命案通過，而負責預備隊人事的盟軍總司令部民政局局長考特尼·惠特尼准將、協助建隊與培訓的民事局分室室長懷特菲爾德·薛帕德少將及參謀三部等機構則與其對立，程序在威洛比掣肘之下延宕了一個月。 此後麥克阿瑟和吉田針對指揮官擔任者問題進行了數週商議，才使林敬三成為最終人選。	1 ::: 3	生平 ::: 武職生涯	4
147	On 9 October 1950, Hayashi was appointed to head the NPR. Formal appointment as Superintendent-General was made on 23 October.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	5	1950年10月9日，林敬三獲得警察預備隊最高階級「警察監」，10月23日正式任命為指揮官，職稱是「警察預備隊中央本部長」。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	0
147	Later on 29 December, the headquarters of the NPR was restructured as the General Group Headquarters.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	6	12月29日，隨著警察預備隊的指揮部「中央本部」改名「總隊總監部」，其職位也由原本暫稱的中央本部長更為「總隊總監」。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	1
147	Apart from him, some 160 key officials of the NPR were appointed. While most of the key posts, such as Deputy Superintendent-General and commanders of the Regional Units were filled by civilian officials and police officers from the ex-Home Ministry, the influence of those prewar army officers and other right-wing figures, who called Hayashi a "home affairs warlord" , was greatly diminished in the NPR and its successor, the National Safety Force .	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	7	除了林氏之外，尚有包括副總監、管區隊總監等要員在內的160人獲得了任用，中樞崗位大多由前內務省部員及警官把持，舊陸軍人士或右派勢力在預備隊、乃至於之後的陸上自衛隊中受到侷限，使服部卓四郎等舊軍軍官將林稱為「內務軍閥」。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	2
147	Hayashi's first task as the Superintendent-General was to lay down a new mind-set for the NPR, since the "spiritual training"  in the prewar Imperial Japanese Army had been scrapped. Although the post-war forces were no longer be required to pledge absolute allegiance to the Emperor under the post-war "Peace Constitution", the general public was still unfamiliar with the democracy concept that was newly introduced to them and therefore, it was difficult to follow the practice of the US to inject democracy concept into the fundamental mind-set of the NPR.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	8	林敬三上任後，最初的任務是打造警察預備隊的精神基礎，他認為舊陸軍最重要的軍人訓練項目「精神教育」廢除後，預備隊中沒有相應的觀念可加以取代，天皇身為軍人效忠對象的地位亦因戰後「和平憲法」通過而失效，但新引進的民主主義在日本仍不為人所熟悉，難以效法美軍將其納入建軍思想中，這使精神戰力的缺乏成為預備隊幹部擔憂的課題。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	3
147	As the senior management of the NPR was deeply anxious about the lack of a new and appropriate mind-set, Hayashi attempted to explore one by striking a balance between old and new concepts.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	9	有鑑於此，林試圖在新舊兩者間尋求平衡，探索出適合的準則。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	4
147	The new mind-set was finally introduced in a speech he made in March 1951, in which he emphasized, "The fundamental spirit of the NPR I firmly hold [is] patriotism and love of our race". He pointed out that the NPR was loyal to the country and the people, instead of the Emperor. In another speech to the officers of the NPR, he said, "Needless to say, if this organization is to play its rightful role in the new Japan, it must be ‘an organization of the people.’ This must be the fundamental principle upon which this defense force should be established" By formulating the new mind-set, he connected the new post-war defense force with the people and cut-off its lineage with the prewar Japanese armed forces.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	10	1951年3月，他正式發布了基本精神訓詞，公告「警察預備隊的基本精神是愛國心、愛民族心」，將新的部隊效忠對象設定為國家和人民，並在一次向隊員發表的演講中指出「我們為了在新的日本扮演正當角色，先決條件就是成為『國民的軍隊』，預備隊的基調非得在這根本原則上構築不可」，以此將新生的軍事組織和民眾聯繫起來，斬斷與舊日軍的連貫性。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	5
147	On 28 April 1952, Japan regained its status as a sovereign state under the Treaty of San Francisco.  One of the first agendas of Yoshida and his Cabinet was to establish the National Safety Agency  to oversee both the NPR and the Coastal Safety Force .	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	11	1952年4月28日，日本藉由《舊金山和約》的通過而恢復主權國家地位，而吉田內閣也產生了在政府中組建「保安廳」、作為國防機構並統一領導警察預備隊和海上警備隊的構思。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	6
147	Hayashi and Keikichi Masuhara, Director-General of the NPR, supported the idea to put ground and maritime forces under the supervision of a unified body so as to avoid a recurrence of interservice rivalry during the Second World War.  However, the Coastal Safety Force opposed the plan as they feared that they would be marginalized by the NPR, which was larger in scale.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	12	林敬三與時任警察廳本部長官增原惠吉均倡議將海陸二者納入一元化的組織下，以避免二戰時期日本陸海軍間的軍種對立再現，但海上警備隊中出身自日本海軍的隊員卻表示反彈，擔憂組織一體化會讓規模較小的海上部隊受到壓制。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	7
147	At last, Hayashi and Masuhara won the day and the National Safety Agency was formally established on 1 August.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	13	最後，由林及增原一方的主張獲得了落實，保安廳亦於同年8月1日正式掛牌。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	8
147	To tie-in with the establishment of the National Safety Agency, the NPR was restructured as the NSF, with Hayashi becoming Chief of the 1st  Staff  to head the First Staff Office, which was the top decision making body of the NSF. In September 1952, he was appointed to a newly formed high-level planning committee in the capacity of Chief of the 1st Staff. Other members of the committee included Chief of the 2nd Staff  and other senior officials of the National Safety Agency. The objective of the committee was to formulate long-term military planning for Japan.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	14	隨著保安廳的創立，警察預備隊改稱保安隊，林敬三的總隊總監職銜也跟著換為「保安廳第一幕僚長」，即陸上幕僚長的前身職位，領導保安隊指揮部——第一幕僚監部，並在1952年9月加入由第一幕僚長、第二幕僚長和保安廳次長、局長、課長級人員構成的「制度調查委員會」，制定日本的長期武力發展計畫。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	9
147	Besides, units and formations in NSF expanded considerably under the command of Hayashi. New units, such as the Northern Army, were formed, while the National Safety Academy and the NSF Aviation School were both founded in 1952.	1 ::: 3	Biography ::: National Police Reserve	15	林敬三幕僚長任內的幕僚監部下轄單位也有所增編，除警察預備隊時代即有的管區隊、直屬部隊外，尚新設了編制更大的方面隊及培養幹部的保安大學校，訓練飛行員的陸上自衛隊航空學校亦於同年創校。	1 ::: 3 ::: 1	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 警察預備隊、保安隊時期	10
147	When the Japanese Defense Agency  and the Japan Self-Defense Forces  were formed on 1 July 1954, the NSF and the Coastal Safety Force were restructured as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force  and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force  respectively.  The two Forces, together with the newly formed Japan Air Self-Defense Force , were the three major components of the JSDF. The Joint Staff Council  was also formed on top of the three Forces, with Hayashi becoming Chairman of JSC with rank of General, which was equivalent to Chief of the General Staff in other countries.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	0	1954年7月1日自衛隊與防衛廳成立後，保安隊正式易名為陸上自衛隊，陸海空三大部隊之上也同時設置了聯合參謀機構「統合幕僚會議」，首屆議長之位由林敬三接掌，此為自衛隊中的最高武職，相當於他國的三軍總參謀長。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	0
147	The JSC served under the Director-General of JDA and Hayashi was responsible for assisting in formulating overall defense plans, supplies plans and training plans, as well as coordinating related plans prepared by the Ground, Maritime and Air Staff Offices and operation directives as issued by the JSDF.

147	Since the Defense Agency attached much importance to the research and development of missiles soon after the founding of JSDF, he met Major-General Gerald D. Higgins, the US Chief of Military Assistance Advisory Group in Japan , in August 1954, to exchange views on the possibility of sending JSDF personnel to the US to study countermeasures against missile attack. In September 1954, he visited the US under invitation of the US Department of Defense.  In Washington, D.C., he met Charles Erwin Wilson, US Secretary of Defense, and Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among other top politicians and military officials.  They held high-level strategic conferences, discussing issues on deployment of US troops to Japan and Korea, collective military actions, as well as the possibility of providing sufficient jet planes and destroyers to strengthen the power of the JSDF.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	3	自衛隊成立不久後，防衛廳視導彈開發與研究為重要議題，他即在1954年8月與駐日美軍顧問團團長傑勞德·希金斯少將會晤，就自衛隊派員赴美學習導彈攻擊應對措施一事交換意見，並於9月獲美國國防部邀請而前往華盛頓特區會見國防部長查爾斯·威爾遜及參謀長聯席會議主席亞瑟·雷德福上將等軍政要員，進行了高層戰略會議，討論駐韓美軍重新部署後的日本實務防衛、兩國共同軍事行動等議題，林還要求美方供應大量噴射機及驅逐艦以加強自衛隊實力。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	3

147	By the end of the 1950s, Japan had already become an important ally in the Western defense system as dominated by the US. To foster closer ties with other allies of the US, Hayashi paid several visits to some of these countries.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	5	至1950年代後期，日本已在美國影響下牢固於西方防衛體系中，林敬三也在統幕議長任期內出訪了美國以外的數個盟邦。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	5
147	In particular, he paid a visit to the United Kingdom  under the invitation of the British government from 5 to 16 May 1957, during which he visited the British Armed Forces and their facilities in London and other places. It was the first formal visit of a senior Japanese general officer to the UK since 1937, when Lieutenant-General Masaharu Homma attended the coronation ceremony of King George VI.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	6	1957年5月5日至16日間，他受英國政府邀約，赴倫敦等地視察英軍陸海空各部隊和裝備，是1937年本間雅晴中將出席英王喬治六世的加冕大典以來，首度有日本高階將官正式訪英。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	6
147	After visiting the UK, Hayashi arrived at Bonn, West Germany on 21 May 1957. On the following day, he met Franz Josef Strauss, Federal Minister of Defense, and Generalleutnant Adolf Heusinger, Inspector General of the Bundeswehr. It was the first post-war meeting between military chiefs of Japan and Germany and they achieved productive agreements on building a military exchange mechanism.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	7	結束在英國的行程後，他又於5月21日前往西德首都波昂，翌日與德國國防部長列表弗朗茨·約瑟夫·施特勞斯和其三軍總長——德國聯邦國防軍總監阿道夫·豪辛格中將會晤，為戰後德日兩國第一次軍方首腦對談，會後雙邊達成協議，同意建立共同軍事事務交流。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	7
147	On 14 and 15 November 1959, Hayashi attended a multinational military conference as hosted by Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander of the US Pacific Command, at Baguio, the Philippines.

Cabal, Chief of Staff of the Philippines, General Peng Meng-chi, Chief of the General Staff of the Republic of China, as well as other military chiefs from member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with a view to fostering stronger military ties with countries in the Western Pacific Region.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	8	1959年11月14日及15日時，林還以日本軍事代表身分至菲律賓碧瑤參加美軍太平洋司令哈里·唐納德·費耳特上將主導的多國軍事會議，並同菲律賓總參謀長列表曼紐爾·卡巴爾中將、中華民國參謀總長彭孟緝上將及東南亞條約組織諸成員國的軍方領袖聚會，發展西太平洋地區的軍事結盟。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	8
147	Although Hayashi was the head of JSDF in the capacity of Chairman of JSC, he had limited powers to assume command in joint operations as the JSC itself was no more than a consultative body.	1 ::: 4	Biography ::: Chairman of Joint Staff Council	9	儘管林敬三有日本自衛隊首長的地位，但由於幕僚會議屬於協商性機構，故他上任之初尚無權指揮跨軍種作戰。	1 ::: 3 ::: 2	生平 ::: 武職生涯 ::: 自衛隊時期	9
147	It was not changed until 1961, when the functions of the JSC were modified and the Chairman was empowered to give orders to the JSDF when there was an operation.
